Which I'm not entertaining atm.  \n  \nSo currently we hunt the siggy shift.  \n  \nRollo: Was the most lit not cleared vanillager to me, hasn't been as active lately. 6/10 Sus  \n  \nQueen: Was fairly lit in that even though it was late her info about the block helped, don't think she's significantly changed her play style or personality.  5/10 Sus  \n  \nFloki: No major read on him, only thing making me doubt he's the shift is that I think it would be a risky shift play for siggy at that time as floki was hovering around the Sus pile... Still. 7/10  \n  \nMe: Obviously know I'm legit vanillager, however I would have been a good target to shift, that said I don't believe my style etc has changed.  0/10 Sus  \n  \nJudy: has been trying to help and don't think her personality has shifted much, same level of \"good to shift\" as me for the same reasons, as such. 7/10  \n  \nKingEcbert:  Logically I think we should lynch him for reasons I explained this morning however I don't get a shift vibe... Which is leaving me uneasy.
