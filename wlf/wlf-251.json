Lurky\n- **Elle:** Slight wolf read. Being passed tarot cards seems fishy. Using poison darts N2\n- **Danny:** Slight town read: Proactive looking back at logs\n\n## Finding the Shifter\n\n - Natasha had rune that said Elle was not a witch, so can't be the shifter\n - Elle said Natasha has lab/dove from tarot cards, since the rune would make her a witch, the lab is false and the \n - dove card can't come from a ss, only a villager or the dire\n - so if claimed things are truthful then those are both ruled out of being the shifter\n- I have more to add later\n\n\n## Rune check on me\n\n\nI confirm the witch check, I also have a rune and have kept quiet about it. Checked Alison N1 and got \"not witchcraft\" back. But I did drop a hint yesterday (almost accidentally) at 15:31 when talking about Alison's role - \"you have to be paranoid I think\" and I said \"oh wait ignore me\" to try and cover it. I also have a note in my summary that says \"I have more to add later\" - it was this reveal.\n\n\nI kept quiet about it because I wanted to try and catch Alison out with a check that wasn't possible. e.g they don't have magic but their checks are different, that means they are lying. Also today, as soon as I reveal it, it cuts down a lot of discussion which I feel is useful.\n\n\nToday I wanted to see if Alison or Danny would actually vote for each other or try to avoid it, I think it put them in a tough spot where they have a non-wolf clear on their side they can't both vote for, and with the \"hedge bets\" strat that Alison mentioned of wolf pairs, she is tied in not voting for me really.\n\n\nMy rune check was Alison does not have witchcraft, so, combined with the info from Elle and Natasha, which I believe, Danny is the only other player that doesn't have a status check, so he has to be the shifter in my eyes. I was always going to vote Danny, but I wanted to see who Danny's scum mate could be. Currently I think the team might be Danny and Alison. I think she got into the vote pile after seeing the writing on the wall.","GameId":"wlf-251","TimeStamp":"2022-11-26T20:34:59.861954Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Haze_with_a_Z","Message":"If they don’t have the item, we don’t know what card comes from them","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"ae4aee2d-1d4b-4e02-ad49-1db9f96d5667","PlayersIdentity":"ElleWoods","GameId":"wlf-251","TimeStamp":"2022-11-26T20:35:10.8925108Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Weresquirrel","Message":"I confirm the witch check on me from Natasha because I also have a rune, I used N1.
