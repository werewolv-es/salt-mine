They also haven't been reading chat as \"DiggingTime Sat 19:24Has there been only one militia claim?\". There was also \"DiggingTime Sun 19:56Kk so why is vamp sus?Sun 19:57Because I feel like Walsh is ok and he voted for him\". To me, I DO NOT trust DiggingTime nor Vampire so this really stood out to me, DiggingTime trusted Walsh without explanation of why. I choose to shoot Walsh because if they are really legit, I trust they would shoot DiggingTime last night (which they possibly did), considering the amount of sus on them. Even if DiggingTime is shifter and shifts away, it possibly wouldn’t be too hard to tell. However, Walsh is deffinetly more experienced so will be much better at shifting away.
