So we tried to tell you that wolves wont go for the vanilla claim n2 because like the chances of hitting any power role is way higher ANYWHERE  else. This is the point where you argued that they could be a PR claiming Vanilla day 2 and this montezuma could be a PR but claiming the vanilla to keep undercover. Then perci points out that it makes no sense for a PR to claim there anyway. Which you for SOME reason took as proving your point. Despite the fact that this absolutely disproves your point because wolves would go with the same assumption and not kill Montezuma n2 because they don't think a PR would claim Vanilla day 2, which is what Perci said. And which is the opposite of what you initially said about Wolves and Montezuma. So we're at a point where you did a full 360° from Montezuma is totally the kill to nobody would kill the villagr claim which is most likely a villager due to your own statement at 16:06. Which brings us to the conclusion that IF I was prot, your argument about my n1 target still being alive is just wrong and you've basically said it yourself. If wolves targeted Monte n1 and I am the prot, even if they knew Monte was protected going for them is a bad play, since they are friggin sure they wont eliminate a PR.
