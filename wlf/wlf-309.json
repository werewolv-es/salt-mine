The GY claims/intel: Ardeth = Villager. Clemons = Strongman, with an unused Prot pot. LockNah = Villager, used block pot on Beni on N2 and had a war axe. He was on sporadically and it was hard to get info. No idea if he used his axe.  Anck = Wolf, did not correct Ardeth when he said ‚ÄúHey wolf‚Äù when she entered the GY. On the question if she was loaded with items she says ‚ÄúNo, not so much‚Äù. But she doesn‚Äôt say anything after that. Ardeth thinks it‚Äôs weird they‚Äôd kill a villager without items over a PR‚Ä¶ So he thinks he got killed by the person who stole his precious hammer. Also, Ardeth is still Ardeth and tells the village to be more proactive and gives a big fluff you to let them know it‚Äôs still him. BADDIES NOW PROBABLY HAVE A HAMMER AND AN AXE. Ardeth is major sus on the Mason claims, that was a weird way to claim it, but the GY doesn‚Äôt give more information on that, so no idea if that‚Äôs a real sus. Ardeths observation throughout the days, so some points are already proven: I feel like Henderson and Beni are lit. Not sure about Gad, but I tend to believe Winston, so that makes Gad super unlit. xD I kinda believe Evie cause she gave the right information about Clemons. No feel about Baltus, he always has meta. Not necessarily sus because of that, but also not a big loss. If he‚Äôs sus, he‚Äôs on the Anck camp, literally the first thing he did when he came on was defending the weird Mason claim. Anck said ‚Äúcheese‚Äù was a reason to recruit N1. Recruiting N1 is always sus from my pov. Winston shows up as soon as it‚Äôs time to sus someone. But, he did try to save LockNah, and he claims to be villager. Daniels wanted to lynch him‚Ä¶ Also, Anck always shows up whenever sus is spread on her. Winston‚Äôs plan on proving they‚Äôre MS was awesome. Anck didn‚Äôt want to go for it, says enough. She could have been lit but chose not to for whatever reason. Make sure you know that this are my observations from this day, not actual proof. Also, I would love to point out that I did not ‚Äúgrill your ass‚Äù. You just took a long time to get to the point. It‚Äôs annoying to constantly see you feeling it as being grilled, that‚Äôs part of the game.
