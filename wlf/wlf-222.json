My concerns around this claim are as follows:\n1. Five said “good morning” at 15:24 on D2, which suggests he comes on later in the day. This makes him an easy target for this accusation: the other  claimed target is dead, and Five will only be able to defend himself when a big stack of votes is already on him. \n\n2. Apollo did not given particularly convincing reasons for choosing his N1 and N2 targets. N1 it was “random” (the first and last names on the list, incidentally). N2 it was the “talkative [Helo] vs less talkative”. Why Five?\n\n3. Apollo did not speak as much as I would have expected from a player who knows they are going to die. He also warned us against believing any other intel, which was sus imo.\n\n# Suspicions around Longshot \nLongshot accused Number Two on D4 of being overly defensive of Apollo, and voted to lynch him. A couple of things suggest he might be Apollo-post-shift:\n1. Longshot actually changed his vote after Cylon had cast the deciding vote to lynch Five. In other words, he sided with Two and did not oppose him as strongly as on D4. \n2. Caine confirmed a couple of differences in Longshot’s style between D3 and D4, notably a change in referring to Two and Five in the way Apollo used to do. \n\n# Bloodletting\nTwo claims aura diviner with a N2 bloodmark check on Helo, with neighbours Gaius and One. A couple of things suggest the mark is likely to have been placed on One:\n1. Helo was killed and therefore a less likely target of the mark. \n2. Caine claims an arcanist check N2 on Caius and ColonelT showing no difference in cards. If we believe that check, then either they are both villagers and One was marked, or Gaius was bloodlet and ColonelT is a BL. OR: both Gaius and One were marked and the colonel is a BL. Note the colonel has been voting One since D4.\n\nThere is a possibility Helo was marked on N1, and neither One nor Gaius was marked N2. Helo being marked implies that Apollo's N2 check led to the lynch of an innocent Five, whether Apollo was legit or not. It also means the COLONEL WOULD BE A BL - according to Caine's N2 check. In short, in all scenarios either One was BL't or is being accused by a wolf.\n\n# Suspicions between ColonelT and One\nColonelT has accused One of acting like a wolf after One evaded claiming for a while on D4. Intel claimed by Caine and Two on the colonel and One implies the following:\n1. One as a wolf and ColonelT as a villager is only possible if one of Cain and Two have given false intel\nOR Helo was BL't N1, which seems a waste. BL'ing Helo N1 would also mean Five was innocent if Apollo's check on N2 between Helo and Five is to be believed.\n2. ColonelT as a wolf and One as a villager is only possible if Cain’s intel is false OR the colonel was shifted by Apollo on N3.\n3. Both ColonelT and One as villagers is possible whether or not the intel is correct.\n4. Both ColonelT and One as wolves seems far fetched as they are both arguably the most vocal in their suspicions of each other.\n\n# ColonelT's theory of wolves\nColonelT has worked out a scenario based on believing all the intel given by Apollo, Two and Cain and assuming all three wolves are still alive. This clears the following people:\n- Billy (based on Apollo's check of Billy and the colonel, and the colonel appearing neutral in two subsequent checks by Caine who compared him with Gaius and Helo);\n- Gaius (based on Caine's neutral check between him and the colonel N2, and assuming Ellen is a BL who marked Gaius N4);\n- Admiral Cain (based on believing their checks);\n- ColonelT (based on 3 consecutive checks by Cain and the assumption Cylon was BL't).\n\nWeaknesses in the theory:\n- trust in Caine's checks that is unfounded other than the intricacy of them;\n- the very specific scenario of Ellen as a BL marking Gaius on N4 would mean One and Longshot are or were shifters. One started accusing Longshot before anybody else did, so it is unlikely that they are teammates.","GameId":"wlf-222","TimeStamp":"2022-01-16T14:51:18.8915538Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"I would agree, Colonel.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"e46f069b-611e-4f28-a7c9-8cc67865b6f9","GameId":"wlf-222","TimeStamp":"2022-01-16T14:52:24.7744538Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"I have also worked out why the blood mark that Two claimed to have found on N2 MUST have been on me - OR you are a wolf yourself.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"b421e2d6-3a2b-44b5-95d6-47545079cefe","GameId":"wlf-222","TimeStamp":"2022-01-16T14:53:25.1823435Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"No, sorry","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"68cc6dbb-02f0-44e3-af7e-8d43243242e1","GameId":"wlf-222","TimeStamp":"2022-01-16T14:55:53.1980211Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"I've realised a mistake I made","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"c4acb997-5ba2-4ab4-988b-1b1e9c935db0","GameId":"wlf-222","TimeStamp":"2022-01-16T14:56:03.2500124Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"I keep mixing up Caine's N1 and N2 checks between you on the one hand and Gaius and Helo respectively on the other","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"07b80c85-dfdf-4333-8e0f-c79e54384dcc","GameId":"wlf-222","TimeStamp":"2022-01-16T14:56:46.4542631Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"I'll go back to my notes in the summary and will try to tidy them up.

My concerns around this claim are as follows:\n1. Five said “good morning” at 15:24 on D2, which suggests he comes on later in the day. This makes him an easy target for this accusation: the other  claimed target is dead, and Five will only be able to defend himself when a big stack of votes is already on him. \n\n2. Apollo did not given particularly convincing reasons for choosing his N1 and N2 targets. N1 it was “random” (the first and last names on the list, incidentally). N2 it was the “talkative [Helo] vs less talkative”. Why Five?\n\n3. Apollo did not speak as much as I would have expected from a player who knows they are going to die. He also warned us against believing any other intel, which was sus imo.\n\n# Suspicions around Longshot \nLongshot accused Number Two on D4 of being overly defensive of Apollo, and voted to lynch him. A couple of things suggest he might be Apollo-post-shift:\n1. Longshot actually changed his vote after Cylon had cast the deciding vote to lynch Five. In other words, he sided with Two and did not oppose him as strongly as on D4. \n2. Caine confirmed a couple of differences in Longshot’s style between D3 and D4, notably a change in referring to Two and Five in the way Apollo used to do. \n\n# Bloodletting\nTwo claims aura diviner with a N2 bloodmark check on Helo, with neighbours Gaius and One. A couple of things suggest the mark is likely to have been placed on One:\n1. Helo was killed and therefore a less likely target of the mark. \n2. Caine claims an arcanist check N2 on Helo and ColonelT showing no difference in cards. If we believe that check, then either they are both villagers and at least one of One and Gaius was marked, OR ColonelT is a BL.\n3. Caine's N1 check rules out Gaius being marked N1. The only way the mark can not have been on One N2 is if Gaius was marked N2 and someone other than One on N1.\n4. If you compare Gaius and One on D2, you may struggle to find a reason to BL Gaius that night specifically.\n\nThere is a possibility Helo was marked on N1, and neither One nor Gaius was marked N2. Helo being marked implies that Apollo's N2 check led to the lynch of an innocent Five, whether Apollo was legit or not. It also means the COLONEL WOULD BE A BL - according to Caine's N2 check.\n\nIn short, of all the scenarios the ones in which One was BL't or is being accused by a wolf seem realistic enough.\n\n# Suspicions between ColonelT and One\nColonelT has accused One of acting like a wolf after One evaded claiming for a while on D4. Intel claimed by Caine and Two on the colonel and One implies the following:\n1. One as a wolf and ColonelT as a villager is only possible if one of Cain and Two have given false intel OR Gaius was BL't N2 (for no obvious reason compared to other players (like One, who had only shown up in the last 12 minutes or so)).\n2. ColonelT as a wolf and One as a villager is only possible if Cain’s intel is false OR the colonel was shifted by Apollo on N3.\n3. Both ColonelT and One as villagers is possible whether or not the intel is correct.\n4. Both ColonelT and One as wolves seems far-fetched as they are both arguably the most vocal in their suspicions of each other.\n\n# ColonelT's theory of wolves\nColonelT has worked out a scenario based on believing all the intel given by Apollo, Two and Cain and assuming all three wolves are still alive. This clears the following people:\n- Billy (based on Apollo's check of Billy and the colonel, and the colonel appearing neutral in two subsequent checks by Caine who compared him with Gaius and Helo);\n- Gaius (based on Caine's neutral check between him and the colonel N2, and assuming Ellen is a BL who marked Gaius N4);\n- Admiral Cain (based on believing their checks);\n- ColonelT (based on 3 consecutive checks by Cain and the assumption Cylon was BL't).\n\nWeaknesses in the theory:\n- trust in Caine's checks that is unfounded other than the intricacy of them;\n- the very specific scenario of Ellen as a BL marking Gaius on N4 would mean One and Longshot are or were shifters. One started accusing Longshot before anybody else did, so it is unlikely that they are teammates.","GameId":"wlf-222","TimeStamp":"2022-01-16T15:54:04.754553Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"OK, Longshot, who do you think Apollo may have shifted to?","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"1557fdd0-c438-435e-bf92-889f68e32aa2","GameId":"wlf-222","TimeStamp":"2022-01-16T15:54:49.4981726Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Oh","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"5f3ca1ec-eefd-4d44-9d7c-7020fdbe3e3d","GameId":"wlf-222","TimeStamp":"2022-01-16T15:55:03.4396606Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Refresh","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"1dd17f12-d885-4304-bec9-e119ddee60d5","GameId":"wlf-222","TimeStamp":"2022-01-16T15:55:09.3698102Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Hoping you're still around","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"7d7b38f9-e963-4e3d-97f8-e43ee7eb6ad5","GameId":"wlf-222","TimeStamp":"2022-01-16T15:56:40.63332Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Caine I'd like to ask why they didn't actually compare the colonel with Apollo","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"b20841e1-ba4f-407f-b1f3-1ec05889099d","GameId":"wlf-222","TimeStamp":"2022-01-16T15:58:16.6437795Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.PlayerSummaryUpdated, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Summary":"# Caution regarding Apollo\nOn D3, Apollo claimed Arcanist early in the day and accused Number Five based on a Death card between Five and Helo, who had died.
