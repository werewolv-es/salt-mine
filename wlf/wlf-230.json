(Mitsuru, Delphinium).\nIs questionable wolf tactic according to Alpha.\n- Possibly a villager using a weapon on the zealot claim (Alpha, Delphinium)\n- Possibly a kill baited by a zealot claim from a diseased or villager (Delphinium). Doubted by Alpha and DrFrankxx.  \n- Possibly the zealot using a dagger on a village visitor and wolves hitting a protective item (Alpha).\nNot confirmed by a player with a broken protection claim, so nope.\n- Possibly a zealot with a weapon killing fake-claiming Ichigo (Dr Franxx). Seems far fetched.\n## Sus on Mitsuru\nMitsuru first claimed no weapon, and has pushed on people to claim items even after warnings weapons were a no-go area.\nThey kept pushing with the promise of a plan to specify 3 or 4 people that would include a wolf. This plan:\n- assumed the cleared person did not have a crossbow (which is impossible to tell with a Sj√≥n rune);\n- did not state the cleared person, who could have had a wolf pelt to disprove Mits, or confirm them if they didn't have a pelt.\n\nMitsuru doesn't want to tell us the cleared person to protect them (because they have no wolf pelt). I have said they could have a dagger or a shield or be diseased, so they would not be an automatic wolf snack, but it doesn't seem to fly with anyone although no reasons etc. I also think it's weird to expect two people to claim their wolf pelts as part of a plan where you want to keep one person hidden that doesn't have a pelt. \n## Sus on M9\n- Vanilla slip on Sjon rune claim;\n- Random accusation of Delta based on useless intel regarding 2 dead people and some unconfirmed magic source.\n## Link between the two\nM9 randomly said Mits felt like a vanilla to them before claiming the Sjon rune. Would be interesting to get a role claim from Mitsuru.","GameId":"wlf-230","TimeStamp":"2022-03-27T19:33:24.1876514Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"And this is actually the main reason that I am not voting M9 atm","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"524175f2-0d51-435f-9d0d-1ad9e3940795","GameId":"wlf-230","TimeStamp":"2022-03-27T19:34:49.1029868Z","RequiredUpToDay":2},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"sia2022","Message":"while we are at it.
