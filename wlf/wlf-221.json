This can only have been Alderp.\n- If Darkness was a wolf, then Kyouya lied about the death card for Wiz and Darkness.","GameId":"wlf-221","TimeStamp":"2022-01-01T12:57:00.7424132Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Hehe, I just found out how to make nice line breaks in the summary thing by adding a - or a number with a stop,","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"041cf654-7db0-495a-8d54-e2a726d5f32e","GameId":"wlf-221","TimeStamp":"2022-01-01T12:58:48.256797Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Pavowski","Message":"Hello","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"8e908534-1408-4dac-9b9a-a97c453a3dd0","GameId":"wlf-221","TimeStamp":"2022-01-01T13:01:45.0829937Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Hi Beldia!","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"4231f504-95f9-42f0-b739-2a3e8778ae0e","GameId":"wlf-221","TimeStamp":"2022-01-01T13:02:00.6406793Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Pavowski","Message":"No more smites today please!","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"93001a72-3958-4eb5-88ba-2681f9c81990","GameId":"wlf-221","TimeStamp":"2022-01-01T13:02:03.4090628Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Hmmm","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"d241a050-ce5a-447e-8554-f78ba27b8d11","GameId":"wlf-221","TimeStamp":"2022-01-01T13:03:48.7263848Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Pavowski","Message":"I will say coming in today that my working theory is Eris was an SS, I did not at all dig the way they voted at end of day to dodge smite","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"f208c54c-b89c-4397-9d7d-1ca3694330bb","GameId":"wlf-221","TimeStamp":"2022-01-01T13:04:50.7476349Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"If Darkness and Vanir were both real then maybe a wolf got smited (Lean)...","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"ee8ef8c4-ae98-4a63-9016-e1b846792d4c","GameId":"wlf-221","TimeStamp":"2022-01-01T13:05:07.0433507Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Pavowski","Message":"And I was gonna come in guns blazing on that slot today but surprise, they're dead","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"edbe1b89-f9e5-46a9-be41-653f6c5a10e7","GameId":"wlf-221","TimeStamp":"2022-01-01T13:05:41.6829875Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"I'm glad somebody agrees with me on that.
