I said from the begining i believed tank and apoc to be a team. I don't know why. It was more or less a gut feeling. I was right on the money when I said Tank was it. With Apoc.. I am still not 100 percent on what he is. Difficult to say. The only logical explanation for him not to be lynched the day he was supposed to be was that he is a wolf with tank. I can say that Tank didn't want to move off of me to seem legit. And tbh he didn't have to. Neo moved. But that basically needs to make me believe that Neo himself as a wolf didn't take the oppurtunity and let Apoc drown as a villager and take the oppurtunity to have a chance to win with a miss lynch? Hard to believe that one. I promised to Trinity I wont move to Neo again and that I would choose Apoc. In todays conversations i could mostly see a wolf in both of you in some instances but more so in Apoc. Yes I am trying to see who of you two seemed to have the knowledge that I am an Elder. Both of you masked it perfectly. If Apoc is thr wolf he masked it brilitantly by defending me and basically going for jones the most out of everyone. I accused Apoc of being a wolf he never once showed emotions towards that and he still didnt vote me. He voted me D3 when we had to decide who is who. But always menitioned that he would snipe. Was that again wolf tactic? If it was he masked it briliantly again. Neo trully seemed like a true villager. Only when there was a vote between tank and I did he seem to lean more towards one side then the other. I wish now that I hadnt made the decision to move of Neo yesterday. Had it been a miss lynch todays decision would have been easier. My gut tells me that the wolf is apoc. If am wrong and Neo truly duped me, well, its deserved.
