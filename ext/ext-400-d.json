Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"enna","Message":"Day 5: Covenment and Flapwagon are revived. MinerRat and MattDemon die in the night. Sparrow pushes for people to claim who they voted for the tunnels as soon as they come online. Covenment the Drunk Seer brings grave intel, confirms the Psychic, presents their own check on KneeG as wolfpack, plus information from Shine on confessing to be a Wulfkin Stalker in the grave, and talking about the clans such as Deathmaw, pledging and overthrowing etc (you guys seem to know more about this than us now). Mark starts to shout a lot about lynching the Wolf Hunter claim, but Anime has gone off on his quest (worth noting here that he doesn't mention Rocks at all who he, the next day, claims he had an untrustworthy check on). KneeG claims Stalker with accurate stalks. Emoji very confusingly begins to hint towards claiming, says Anime is lit and announces both Qui and their self have wolf blood. Balls brings in the information about quest points & failures from 400a and claims Drunk Seer with a wolf check on Voice. My notes make a point of noting Mark's shitposts throughout both of these days so I'm going to note them here too. Qui reveals that he has an invite from the Inquisition and Emoji reveals that they were drunk for the first two days. I notice DW shouldn't have come up as Hound for GreatYear and village begin to discuss their distrust for him. Emoji claims Child of Acer, with the faction Children of Acer. Emoji has the most votes for a while but when googling I see that Acer is the scientific name for Maple and along with GameHater who later reveals they trusted Qui because they stalked their dig, we pull the votes back towards Voice. Balls reveals the roleclaim list of 400a. I begin to distrust Emoji again when realising they got RBed by my blessing, defining them as 'unholy', but I then lean to semi-trusting them again to due to the name Acer, their persistence in the chat and honesty of claim. Savvy does a nice TLDR of what occurred in 400a (I guess I might have to rewrite that too if Balls can't be bothered). Sus returns, now super active, claims they were a Drunk and are now GD. Qui reveals that he had a \"private message from Emoji by unknown means about the Inquisition\" (no clue if this meant recruit mod message but I feel I must add it to show the level of sketch there was that day). Emoji denies being Inquisition, doesn't know why Qui said it, and is candid about being Child of Acer. KneeG is very much against Emoji and thinks the Acer=Maple connection is a stretch. Savvy puts forward his theories that Emoji is Cult Leader, Anime is Blood Seer and Qui recruited. HungryMaple notes that he trusts Voice's voters more than Emoji's voters. Flag makes excuses for not being able to make notes because there's no Liveviewer, thinks Swearwolves is Medium. GameIdeas explains his role as the Master Of Whispers (Shit, think I forgot to add that to the list because he died) He says there are players in the game with orbs, and his role functions as if he has an orb, but it's his role instead. He says people abused it immediately, pretending to be eachother. It was mostly nonsense, and worries about there being a Vamp. He states his role is WC and village-alligned. They used a callsign system of 3 letter acronyms to differentiate one another. FlagWagon reveals his 5 potential Mason Leaders (GeroMyLove(n1), SingleVisit(n5), GreatYear, OhioStone, Furrie). Mark emotionally (lots of ??????????s) questions why we are voting out the Drunk Harlot over the Stalker, saying the Stalker could be Cult Follower. GameIdeas and Savvy are sus of eachother. Flap double-confirms the Psychic said Gero's code and confirms everything else Covenment brought from the grave. I push for more personal opinions on what 400a felt like for the questers, a couple of people mention how GrandVizibear wasn't very active or memorable. They had been suspicious of the drunks there, and day 1 was apparently very villagey with everyone seemingly onboard, which changed the next day after the first quest failure. Votes had been \"extremely close\" between Voice and Clarity for most of the day, then at the end of the day shifted to Clarity. Clarity was a Drunk. GameIdeas was poisoned (n3) during the quest, and VoiceSpuds had been dug as Assassin. I present the theory that poisoning comes from Assassins, which would mean we had 2 Assassins back on the original 400 (Owler and Doubt poisoned n3). SingleVisit drops in for literally one single visit to say the game doesn't load on his phone. Voice states that Ohio trusting both him and Clarity was weird. Sparrow wants to mistrust revives. Savvy makes a point of distrusting Emoji, Ohio and GameIdeas. Flap discussing avatars day 5 struck me as filler shitpost. Olaf points out how it's not suspicious that Covenment's revive hasn't been claimed, given that people left for a quest (he claims the revive tomorrow). Flap, despite being around for some hours, questions why Voice has votes. Sus wants a last minute snipe on KneeG, for being the confessed evil clan Stalker. Voting for VoiceSpuds: Balls, Yout, HungryMaple, StoryTime, Skinchanger, Owlder, FURune, NightOneRevive, Silver_sparrow, FlapWagon, OhioStone. (VoiceSpuds dug later to be Wulfkin Assassin). Savvy states that Ohio was told not to do anything on the quest when Ohio reveals they used their -1 supply there. Voice is lynched.

We see the new pledge messages at the beginning of day (Redfang>Swiftclaw and Swiftclaw>Wolfpack). FURune is hardly active yet mentions their computer troubles at 15:06 and at 20:38 (I noted this incase it was a really crap shift). Qui confirms the Children of Acer story. Emoji failed a recruit but didn't say who. Olaf gave away his extra supplies (Because of him saying that, I wanted to give away one of my 2s but it seems we can only send all supplies at once, not pick and choose? Can't question Olaf on this now, so please whoever returns to OG, question him). It's KneeG's birthday and his gift to us is a confession, he claims Mark is Redfang Assassin. He reveals that the clan leaders have a scroll for pledging alliance and it gets passed from each member, but he didn't get it. Mark counterclaims that he is Novice Seer. He claims he didn't reveal his Rocks-untrustworthy because they went off to the quest. Skinchanger claims Drunk. Flag pushes hard for a full claim and appears emotional about it, despite always making Liveviewer excuses for not having notes or re-reading. It's thought that only Balls has used up their Potion of Clarity so far. The pressure train vote StoryTime but StoryTime never appears. Flap states they have no supplies because of dying, and wants to stay behind. Sus volunteers to go on the quest. Mark shitposts large numbers like +24423, asking to go on the quest. Owlder claims Drunk. Olaf claims Reviver and that he revived Covenment and kept quiet hoping for refresh. Mark does an avatar shitpost. Vizibear offers to dig the lynch as he's confessed and is less important, and the other two can dig GameIdeas. Silver refuses to claim but promises that it's important they claim tomorrow. Flag, Vizibear, Covenment and Killscreen are against Silver. SingleVisit also doesn't want to reveal yet, and claims having an n1 village check by Gero the DS claim who has been dug up and confirmed as DS, but nobody has dug up Gero, SingleVisit is both incorrect and not reading the game. SingleVisit thinks there's some bullshittery going on with the Lostmason claim. Flap aggressively talks about killing everyone who voted KneeG and left (even though KneeG is confessed evil). FURune agrees that everyone should full claim yet doesn't join the pressure train. HungryMaple comes in with a massive paragraph claiming Drunk. GameHater claims Stalker and saw Savvy visiting both Emoji+Sparrow, mass Savvy votes ensue. Savvy had already claimed RBed trying to visit Emoji, so his story now goes that he used the drunkness potion on Emoji, and denies the visit to Sparrow. He claims he has a Circlet that blocks wc users and that NightOneRevive must be lying about being prot since they did not claim RBed. Towards the very end of the day, Savvy confesses to be Bloodhound (I later realise I don't think that fits with the killer status he claimed?) and claims his Circlet story was true. This is the part I didn't re-read fully so if anyone wants any particular nuance/player's biases let me know and I'll go and see. Savvy is lynched.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"975f18b0-a14b-45fb-b30f-13c1c2e939f6","GameId":"ext-400-d","TimeStamp":"2021-01-07T12:40:31.2591478Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent,
