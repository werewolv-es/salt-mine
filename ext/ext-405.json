I think I'm absolutely ok with Saruman (I will follow you everywhere!) and Merry, I think. only option is them going from Harlot to fam harlot and now they would have reverted and no check. thats easy to verify I think. Not sure about Aragorn, cause they would have known if Elrond was lit either way. I'm OK with Witchking, cause we both dug the N2 kill that had not claimed (I mean court was always possible due to the claimed block the orb gang talked about, but we assumed an orb or item as well, so maybe it is not to far a guess they were court after all) Not sure about the AD, there is still the aura that is \"off\"; the Prot is a bit weird in this setup. but the cloak stuff does not make much sense. if they had fammed last night the kill would have to be from an item. and that could have been used to hide \"transformation\" or famming N1/N3; ","GameId":"ext-405","TimeStamp":"2021-07-01T15:33:48.5778326Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Niji","Message":"I already said I am ok for sure with Grima till d3 (I think d3), but they claimed super late, so way claim priestess if you can't cleanse and will be outed rtather soon?","GameId":"ext-405","TimeStamp":"2021-07-01T15:34:33.5948894Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Niji","Message":"well thats a wall of text and I'm not really further into who is most sus.","GameId":"ext-405","TimeStamp":"2021-07-01T15:35:08.053208Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Niji","Message":"anyways all this and basically a possibly village nightchat (that totally can and will be compromised, cause whispering...) seems really harsh on one VC.","GameId":"ext-405","TimeStamp":"2021-07-01T15:35:44.6691616Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Rox","Message":"I mean.....might not be so harsh anymore considering it could be 2 vs 8 and will be picking us off soon","GameId":"ext-405","TimeStamp":"2021-07-01T15:37:51.4224624Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Niji","Message":"with all the harlots and a prot plus blocks (well not many now)","GameId":"ext-405","TimeStamp":"2021-07-01T15:38:33.5792879Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Rox","Message":"Yeah","GameId":"ext-405","TimeStamp":"2021-07-01T16:12:13.6354963Z"},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Niji","Message":"as of now it points to indecisive votes or no lynch?
