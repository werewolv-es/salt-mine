I suppose as long as they don't use their magics for ill, I'll not consider them to weigh the same as a duck, and act accordingly.\n\n*\n\n#### Day 3: \nI received a small trinket with a picture inside that warmed my heart.

They indeed dabbled with the arcane arts, but I'll keep their identity classified until I have other reasons to suspect them of ill-intent. I suppose as long as they don't use their magics for ill, I'll not consider them to weigh the same as a duck, and act accordingly.\n\n*\n\n#### Day 3: \nI received a small trinket with a picture inside that warmed my heart. I felt the impulse to give away all my possessions, and so I no longer own Tarot cards. In addition, I looked into the case of ArchchancellorRidcully. He doesn't seem to possess any magical ability.\n\nI've been given the authority to de-classify the nature of my 1st case file. A Flatulent dog named Gaspode somehow breams with arcane power.

It had Tarots and 3 other items. It started with 4 items: 1 - 1 - (2) - ((3)). I took the Tarots. In addition, I looked into a person suspected of witchery. They indeed dabbled with the arcane arts, but I'll keep their identity classified until I have other reasons to suspect them of ill-intent. I suppose as long as they don't use their magics for ill, I'll not consider them to weigh the same as a duck, and act accordingly.\n\n*\n\n#### Day 3: \nI received a small trinket with a picture inside that warmed my heart. I felt the impulse to give away all my possessions, and so I no longer own Tarot cards. In addition, I looked into the case of ArchchancellorRidcully. He doesn't seem to possess any magical ability.\n\nI've been given the authority to de-classify the nature of my 1st case file. A Flatulent dog named Gaspode somehow breams with arcane power. He claims to be a member of a faction, but I know of none that use witchcraft.

It had Tarots and 3 other items. It started with 4 items: 1 - 1 - (2) - ((3)). I took the Tarots. In addition, I looked into a person suspected of witchery. They indeed dabbled with the arcane arts, but I'll keep their identity classified until I have other reasons to suspect them of ill-intent. I suppose as long as they don't use their magics for ill, I'll not consider them to weigh the same as a duck, and act accordingly.\n\n*\n\n#### Day 3: \nI received a small trinket with a picture inside that warmed my heart. I felt the impulse to give away all my possessions, and so I no longer own Tarot cards. The recipient was involved in an unfortunate death, however, so I've placed them in her casket (RIP, Miss Aching). In addition, I looked into the case of ArchchancellorRidcully. He doesn't seem to possess any magical ability.\n\nI've been given the authority to de-classify the nature of my 1st case file. A Flatulent dog named Gaspode somehow breams with arcane power. He claims to be a member of a faction, but I know of none that use witchcraft.

They indeed dabbled with the arcane arts, but I'll keep their identity classified until I have other reasons to suspect them of ill-intent. I suppose as long as they don't use their magics for ill, I'll not consider them to weigh the same as a duck, and act accordingly.\n\n*\n\n#### Day 3: \nI received a small trinket with a picture inside that warmed my heart. I felt the impulse to give away all my possessions, and so I no longer own Tarot cards. The recipient was involved in an unfortunate death, however, so I've placed them in her casket (RIP, Miss Aching). In addition, I looked into the case of ArchchancellorRidcully. He doesn't seem to possess any magical ability.\n\nI've been given the authority to de-classify the nature of my 1st case file. A Flatulent dog named Gaspode somehow breams with arcane power. He claims to be a member of a faction, but I know of none that use witchcraft. I think I'll give him the witch-test tonight.\n\n*\n\n#### Day 4: \nAfter finding the Methane Mongrel guilty of practicing Witchcraft, I had a very uneventful night.

It had Tarots and 3 other items. It started with 4 items: 1 - 1 - (2) - ((3)). I took the Tarots. In addition, I looked into a person suspected of witchery. They indeed dabbled with the arcane arts, but I'll keep their identity classified until I have other reasons to suspect them of ill-intent. I suppose as long as they don't use their magics for ill, I'll not consider them to weigh the same as a duck, and act accordingly.\n\n*\n\n#### Day 3: \nI received a small trinket with a picture inside that warmed my heart. I felt the impulse to give away all my possessions, and so I no longer own Tarot cards. The recipient was involved in an unfortunate death, however, so I've placed them in her casket (RIP, Miss Aching). In addition, I looked into the case of ArchchancellorRidcully. He doesn't seem to possess any magical ability.\n\nI've been given the authority to de-classify the nature of my 1st case file. A Flatulent dog named Gaspode somehow breams with arcane power. He claims to be a member of a faction, but I know of none that use witchcraft. I think I'll give him the witch-test tonight.\n\n*\n\n#### Day 4: \nAfter finding the Methane Mongrel guilty of practicing Witchcraft, I had a very uneventful night. I'll resume my investigative duties at dusk.\n\n*\n\n#### Day 5:\nI looked into MoistVonLipwig's activities last night and found no sign of Witchery. Additionally, I found a gift outside my door. I'll have to send a fruit basket to whomever sent it to me as thanks.","GameId":"mcw-003","TimeStamp":"2025-01-23T13:46:44.2827536Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Gnomish","Message":"@Mort No \"Yay!\"?
