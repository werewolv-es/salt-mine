[CONFLICT 3]\n  - This aligns with IWasBornSwimming being a harlot.\n  - https://archive.werewolv.es/#game=des-154&phase=Night4 shows a pelt breaks still even with protection around.\n\nDay 3 Stuff:\n- Day 2 ended with a shroud, so that means there is coven. So succubus would explain SecondLove not seeing my block N2, so I am no longer sus of them\n- Dory died, much sadness, very heartbroken. But this makes their checks a lot more plausible, so I think both PreludeToEcstasy and HouseWithoutAView are likely evil (one killer, one succubus)\n- House is still my main sus based on vibes around not wanting to pass the crown and the fact they failed to protect Dory.","GameId":"smg-323","TimeStamp":"2025-10-24T17:42:45.0268399Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Niji","Message":"Nothing.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"467d7eaf-dcce-4d2e-8299-620e7e4f6d67","PlayersIdentity":"SecondLove","GameId":"smg-323","TimeStamp":"2025-10-24T17:43:38.8534772Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"BlooDeck","Message":"N1 - Norman, same as what they said nada.

Despite clearly being well aware of the importance of it.\n- Night 2: I blocked SecondLove, who did not claim it and denies it happened. ~~[CONFLICT 1]~~ (Note: NormanFuckingRockwell claimed blocked, but this was not my doing - I was probably redirected now that we know coven exists)\n- Night 3: I blocked TeethMarks, who did not claim it and said they had no messages. [CONFLICT 4] (I was probably redirected, again. SecondLove and NormanFuckingRockwell claimed blocked today, so I was probably the cause of one of them.).\n- Night 4: I had the orb (confirmed pass) and did not try to block anyone (to avoid just being a coven block toy). (SecondLove still claims to be blocked.) TheAnswerIsAlwaysYes claims to have see me visiting SecondLove [CONFLICT 5] but this is not possible with the orb and me not actually visiting.\n\nI started with a wolf pelt. I was given the altrustic trinket on N1 so had to pass them both on N2. I tried to pass them both to PreludeToEcstasy, however the Pelt was broken N2 (presumably, someone attacked me). N3 nothing, N4 Orb.\n\nDay 2 Stuff:\nIWasBornSwimming claims that PreludeToEcstasy and HouseWithoutAView visited me.\n- PreludeToEcstasy claims to have the orb so could not do that. [CONFLICT 2]\n  - (PreludeToEcstasy Could be spellbound)\n- HouseWithoutAView claims to have protected me, which everyone else claims would stop the pelt breaking. [CONFLICT 3]\n  - This aligns with IWasBornSwimming being a harlot.\n  - https://archive.werewolv.es/#game=des-154&phase=Night4 shows a pelt breaks still even with protection around.\n\nDay 3 Stuff:\n- Day 2 ended with a shroud, so that means there is coven. So succubus would explain SecondLove not seeing my block N2, so I am no longer sus of them\n- Dory died, much sadness, very heartbroken. But this makes their checks a lot more plausible, so I think both PreludeToEcstasy and HouseWithoutAView are likely evil (one killer, one succubus)\n- House is still my main sus based on vibes around not wanting to pass the crown and the fact they failed to protect Dory.\n\nDay 4 Stuff:\n- HouseWithAView died, that's an unexpected start to the day given that they were likely a lynch target today. \n- TheAnswerIsAlwaysYes claims to have visited me as a stalker and saw me visiting. Their stalk choices were already questionable, but given that I both chose to go nowhere, and held the orb then this is a very fake check\n- Additionally, GoodRiddance used a seer rune on them and found vampire. This makes sense.\n- Sadly, Dory is still dead. I shall continue to mourn them.\n- I'm still somewhat sus of PreludeToEcstasy from my N2 party.","GameId":"smg-323","TimeStamp":"2025-10-25T13:42:04.1972987Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.GhostMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Lucky","Message":"😴","Recipients":["emilis","Lucky","guyt2030","Mark_T"],"GameId":"smg-323","TimeStamp":"2025-10-25T13:49:54.5207552Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Niji","Message":"Norman still missing ","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"e2ac6611-4433-4453-94a9-72dd4d35f298","PlayersIdentity":"SecondLove","GameId":"smg-323","TimeStamp":"2025-10-25T13:51:37.9622765Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Gnomish","Message":"Speak of the devil!","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"a92f46c6-f6f0-46f4-b2de-d29887266a61","PlayersIdentity":"NormanFuckingRockwell","GameId":"smg-323","TimeStamp":"2025-10-25T13:52:02.2636181Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Gnomish","Message":"Afternoon.

Despite clearly being well aware of the importance of it.\n- Night 2: I blocked SecondLove, who did not claim it and denies it happened. ~~[CONFLICT 1]~~ (Note: NormanFuckingRockwell claimed blocked, but this was not my doing - I was probably redirected now that we know coven exists)\n- Night 3: I blocked TeethMarks, who did not claim it and said they had no messages. [CONFLICT 4] (I was probably redirected, again. SecondLove and NormanFuckingRockwell claimed blocked today, so I was probably the cause of one of them.).\n- Night 4: I had the orb (confirmed pass) and did not try to block anyone (to avoid just being a coven block toy). (SecondLove still claims to be blocked.) TheAnswerIsAlwaysYes claims to have see me visiting SecondLove [CONFLICT 5] but this is not possible with the orb and me not actually visiting.\n- Night 5: I still had the orb and did not try to block anyone (much the same reasons as yesterday). (SecondLove still claims to be blocked along with PreludeToEcstasy and Blondshell. I think Blondshell ran into my Orb?)\n\nI started with a wolf pelt. I was given the altrustic trinket on N1 so had to pass them both on N2. I tried to pass them both to PreludeToEcstasy, however the Pelt was broken N2 (presumably, someone attacked me). N3 nothing, N4 Orb.\n\nDay 2 Stuff:\nIWasBornSwimming claims that PreludeToEcstasy and HouseWithoutAView visited me.\n- PreludeToEcstasy claims to have the orb so could not do that. [CONFLICT 2]\n  - (PreludeToEcstasy Could be spellbound)\n- HouseWithoutAView claims to have protected me, which everyone else claims would stop the pelt breaking. [CONFLICT 3]\n  - This aligns with IWasBornSwimming being a harlot.\n  - https://archive.werewolv.es/#game=des-154&phase=Night4 shows a pelt breaks still even with protection around.\n\nDay 3 Stuff:\n- Day 2 ended with a shroud, so that means there is coven. So succubus would explain SecondLove not seeing my block N2, so I am no longer sus of them\n- Dory died, much sadness, very heartbroken. But this makes their checks a lot more plausible, so I think both PreludeToEcstasy and HouseWithoutAView are likely evil (one killer, one succubus)\n- House is still my main sus based on vibes around not wanting to pass the crown and the fact they failed to protect Dory.\n\nDay 4 Stuff:\n- HouseWithAView died, that's an unexpected start to the day given that they were likely a lynch target today. \n- TheAnswerIsAlwaysYes claims to have visited me as a stalker and saw me visiting. Their stalk choices were already questionable, but given that I both chose to go nowhere, and held the orb then this is a very fake check\n- Additionally, GoodRiddance used a seer rune on them and found vampire. This makes sense.\n- Sadly, Dory is still dead. I shall continue to mourn them.\n- I'm still somewhat sus of PreludeToEcstasy from my N2 party.\n\nDay 5 Stuff:\n- NormanFuckingRockwell is weird. They're claiming to have tried to dig House, and steal from Prelude and ended up stealing from SecondLove and getting no check result.\n  - This would require both a redirect rune and a succubus.","GameId":"smg-323","TimeStamp":"2025-10-26T16:50:53.74928Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Gnomish","Message":"We've only killed one coven so far.

Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ShaneMcC","Summary":"I am a princess!\n\n- Night 1: I blocked BeginToHope, who did not claim it until after I mentioned it. Despite clearly being well aware of the importance of it.\n- Night 2: I blocked SecondLove, who did not claim it and denies it happened. ~~[CONFLICT 1]~~ (Note: NormanFuckingRockwell claimed blocked, but this was not my doing - I was probably redirected now that we know coven exists)\n- Night 3: I blocked TeethMarks, who did not claim it and said they had no messages. [CONFLICT 4] (I was probably redirected, again. SecondLove and NormanFuckingRockwell claimed blocked today, so I was probably the cause of one of them.).\n- Night 4: I had the orb (confirmed pass) and did not try to block anyone (to avoid just being a coven block toy). (SecondLove still claims to be blocked.) TheAnswerIsAlwaysYes claims to have see me visiting SecondLove [CONFLICT 5] but this is not possible with the orb and me not actually visiting.\n- Night 5: I still had the orb and did not try to block anyone (much the same reasons as yesterday). (SecondLove still claims to be blocked along with PreludeToEcstasy and Blondshell. I think Blondshell ran into my Orb?)\n- Night 6: I still had the orb, blocked PreludeToEcstasy. Got strange dreams in the night, so someone must have used the SilenceRune on me.\n\nI started with a wolf pelt. I was given the altrustic trinket on N1 so had to pass them both on N2. I tried to pass them both to PreludeToEcstasy, however the Pelt was broken N2 (presumably, someone attacked me). N3 nothing, N4 Orb.\n\nDay 2 Stuff:\nIWasBornSwimming claims that PreludeToEcstasy and HouseWithoutAView visited me.\n- PreludeToEcstasy claims to have the orb so could not do that. [CONFLICT 2]\n  - (PreludeToEcstasy Could be spellbound)\n- HouseWithoutAView claims to have protected me, which everyone else claims would stop the pelt breaking. [CONFLICT 3]\n  - This aligns with IWasBornSwimming being a harlot.\n  - https://archive.werewolv.es/#game=des-154&phase=Night4 shows a pelt breaks still even with protection around.\n\nDay 3 Stuff:\n- Day 2 ended with a shroud, so that means there is coven. So succubus would explain SecondLove not seeing my block N2, so I am no longer sus of them\n- Dory died, much sadness, very heartbroken. But this makes their checks a lot more plausible, so I think both PreludeToEcstasy and HouseWithoutAView are likely evil (one killer, one succubus)\n- House is still my main sus based on vibes around not wanting to pass the crown and the fact they failed to protect Dory.\n\nDay 4 Stuff:\n- HouseWithAView died, that's an unexpected start to the day given that they were likely a lynch target today. \n- TheAnswerIsAlwaysYes claims to have visited me as a stalker and saw me visiting. Their stalk choices were already questionable, but given that I both chose to go nowhere, and held the orb then this is a very fake check\n- Additionally, GoodRiddance used a seer rune on them and found vampire. This makes sense.\n- Sadly, Dory is still dead. I shall continue to mourn them.\n- I'm still somewhat sus of PreludeToEcstasy from my N2 party.\n\nDay 5 Stuff:\n- NormanFuckingRockwell is weird. They're claiming to have tried to dig House, and steal from Prelude and ended up stealing from SecondLove and getting no check result.\n  - This would require both a redirect rune and a succubus.","GameId":"smg-323","TimeStamp":"2025-10-27T11:34:33.236345Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Joe13","Message":"wait... doesn't the orb prevent you from using your ability princess?","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"179e9791-1cf3-41b6-9516-7fe804d07198","PlayersIdentity":"GoodRiddance","GameId":"smg-323","TimeStamp":"2025-10-27T11:36:37.9603996Z","RequiredUpToDay":7},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ShaneMcC","Message":"It does not","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"7477224e-6241-4518-adec-9879d66871ac","PlayersIdentity":"TheRiseAndFallOfAMidwestPrincess","GameId":"smg-323","TimeStamp":"2025-10-27T11:36:45.9841963Z","RequiredUpToDay":7},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ShaneMcC","Message":"Because courtesan is block-immune","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"476503ab-6f98-49e3-9727-cd92e3bf6b57","PlayersIdentity":"TheRiseAndFallOfAMidwestPrincess","GameId":"smg-323","TimeStamp":"2025-10-27T11:36:56.6793409Z","RequiredUpToDay":7},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Joe13","Message":"oh i love that","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"6a384182-843f-4944-baf7-b538e6919a34","PlayersIdentity":"GoodRiddance","GameId":"smg-323","TimeStamp":"2025-10-27T11:38:31.6845351Z","RequiredUpToDay":7},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ShaneMcC","Message":"That's why I've held onto the Orb - it doesn't impact me, and I've not been sure where I want to pass it.

Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ShaneMcC","Summary":"I am a princess!\n\n- Night 1: I blocked BeginToHope, who did not claim it until after I mentioned it. Despite clearly being well aware of the importance of it.\n- Night 2: I blocked SecondLove, who did not claim it and denies it happened. ~~[CONFLICT 1]~~ (Note: NormanFuckingRockwell claimed blocked, but this was not my doing - I was probably redirected now that we know coven exists)\n- Night 3: I blocked TeethMarks, who did not claim it and said they had no messages. [CONFLICT 4] (I was probably redirected, again. SecondLove and NormanFuckingRockwell claimed blocked today, so I was probably the cause of one of them.).\n- Night 4: I had the orb (confirmed pass) and did not try to block anyone (to avoid just being a coven block toy). (SecondLove still claims to be blocked.) TheAnswerIsAlwaysYes claims to have see me visiting SecondLove [CONFLICT 5] but this is not possible with the orb and me not actually visiting.\n- Night 5: I still had the orb and did not try to block anyone (much the same reasons as yesterday). (SecondLove still claims to be blocked along with PreludeToEcstasy and Blondshell. I think Blondshell ran into my Orb?)\n- Night 6: I still had the orb, blocked PreludeToEcstasy. Got strange dreams in the night, so someone must have used the SilenceRune on me.\n\nI started with a wolf pelt. I was given the altrustic trinket on N1 so had to pass them both on N2. I tried to pass them both to PreludeToEcstasy, however the Pelt was broken N2 (presumably, someone attacked me). N3 nothing, N4 Orb.\n\nDay 2 Stuff:\nIWasBornSwimming claims that PreludeToEcstasy and HouseWithoutAView visited me.\n- PreludeToEcstasy claims to have the orb so could not do that. [CONFLICT 2]\n  - (PreludeToEcstasy Could be spellbound)\n- HouseWithoutAView claims to have protected me, which everyone else claims would stop the pelt breaking. [CONFLICT 3]\n  - This aligns with IWasBornSwimming being a harlot.\n  - https://archive.werewolv.es/#game=des-154&phase=Night4 shows a pelt breaks still even with protection around.\n\nDay 3 Stuff:\n- Day 2 ended with a shroud, so that means there is coven. So succubus would explain SecondLove not seeing my block N2, so I am no longer sus of them\n- Dory died, much sadness, very heartbroken. But this makes their checks a lot more plausible, so I think both PreludeToEcstasy and HouseWithoutAView are likely evil (one killer, one succubus)\n- House is still my main sus based on vibes around not wanting to pass the crown and the fact they failed to protect Dory.\n\nDay 4 Stuff:\n- HouseWithAView died, that's an unexpected start to the day given that they were likely a lynch target today. \n- TheAnswerIsAlwaysYes claims to have visited me as a stalker and saw me visiting. Their stalk choices were already questionable, but given that I both chose to go nowhere, and held the orb then this is a very fake check\n- Additionally, GoodRiddance used a seer rune on them and found vampire. This makes sense.\n- Sadly, Dory is still dead. I shall continue to mourn them.\n- I'm still somewhat sus of PreludeToEcstasy from my N2 party.\n\nDay 5 Stuff:\n- NormanFuckingRockwell is weird. They're claiming to have tried to dig House, and steal from Prelude and ended up stealing from SecondLove and getting no check result.\n  - This would require both a redirect rune and a succubus.\n\nDay 6 Stuff:\n- I had strange dreams in the night. I still hold the orb, so it had to be an item used on me. So the silence rune. (Or tenacious harpy.)\n  - PreludeToEcstasy was known to have this N3. They claim to have passed it to Dory that night.\n  - The fact I got silenced today suggests otherwise, which in my mind makes Prelude a liar.
