Probably fammed militia? Probably shot to cover for a famming N3.\n - **Eight**: Raveyard janitor\n - **Nine**: I believe this seer. Most obviously lit night kill — once revived.\n - **Ten**: Leaning towards trusting Two, making this the BH\n - **Eleven**: _We have so much power now.

They then give me an ominous portent of my own inevitable death lol (ner ner 8 you were wrong lol - I'll pick you tomorrow again in sorry for straying) They then say they trust 9 and think they are a good revive, they worried about a psychic and a reviver in a small game though.

We're taking about a non inebriated true seer hitting two wolves on their first two checks. Is it possible, yes, but pretty unlikely imo. Both for being in the game as well as hitting that well. To me (and I appreciate that thats my PoV-exclusive), Nine is insane. That means (gonna repeat myself now); 10 was lit making 12 a mislynch and 2 either evil or somehow bamboozled. But since I dont believe we'd have 2 GD's, a reviver and a psychic (the last 2 being proved lit), I think I have to vote 2.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"2617890d-3188-497c-891d-c1cbae6463e2","PlayersIdentity":"One","GameId":"smg-322","TimeStamp":"2025-09-04T14:26:48.8529069Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Butters","Message":"if Im insane and get a wolf check does that make them lit ","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"acc1c14d-d4f5-458f-8bba-320f3f6190e7","PlayersIdentity":"Nine","GameId":"smg-322","TimeStamp":"2025-09-04T14:27:53.7043568Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"PapaSmurf","Message":"And also; as has been said both by me and others.

Very diseased. Run away. Shoo!\n\n## Personal opinion\n\n - 1️⃣🐺 **One (Seer check as wolf)**: Weird diseased plays. Could just be clumsy, I get that. But my gut is telling me they're wolf. I don't believe in an insane seer this game, that feels _horrible_ for village. I'd kinda rather give up than believe the seer is insane. \n   - **Scenario:** \n     - One having killed Nine after passing them the Wham! (to farm an item) also makes sense with them having the cloak. \n     - If 11 (vamp) is implicated by 14, vamp goes after 14 N3, and the cloaked OneWolf goes after their own biggest threat — the NTR.\n - 2️⃣ **Two**: GD regardless. ~~80% lit, 20% fammed. If Seven is fammed, that changes to~~ 100% lit imo.\n - 3️⃣👁️🪦 **Three**: I _will_ avenge you!\n - 4️⃣🧙 **Four**: Probably a witch.\n - 5️⃣ **Five (Sus Elder)**: Sus Elder is sus. Voting sus. Sus. sus. But not much more than that to go on.\n - 6️⃣🔮 **Six**: Could've been fammed N3, but they seem lit like a christmas tree.\n - 7️⃣ **Seven (FamMilitia/TunnelVisionMilitia)**: ~~Honestly looks like they're a fam sweating bullets.~~ Probably fammed militia? Guessing they shot to cover for a second famming N3. Seven's vote on Two: \n   - `09:16Seven - Evil didn't want me shooting you last night, so that makes you evil in my eyes`. \n     - Yet the last thing we saw from Seven D3 was `I think for reference my thoughts are to revive eight given the 12 thing, @Four`. \n     - I don't know why Wolf Two would _expect_ Seven to shoot them here. \n       - At best, an extreme case of tunnel vision. \n       - At worst, fammed N2, and thought Two might be the other fam until they hit night chat.\n - 8️⃣🪦 **Eight**: Raveyard janitor\n - 9️⃣~~🪦~~👼 **Nine**: I believe this seer. Most obviously lit night kill — once revived.\n - 🔟🪦🐺 **Ten**: Leaning towards trusting Two, making this the BH\n - {🔟, 1️⃣}🧛 **Eleven (real name: Vladimir)**: ~~_We have so much power now. That's ridiculous._~~\n   - Really sus claim. \n     - Easy to roleplay as a Pagan until it matters. \n   - Can be implicated as vamp due to 14s N1 check with an item visit if 10 BH: \n     - **1 away:** \n       - *Ten* Bloodhounding OR *Eleven* using item.\n     - **2 among (us):** \n       - *Eleven* recruitkilling *Ten* \n       - *Eleven* item use OR *Ten* Bloodhounding\n     - **2 To them:**\n       - *Nine* seer checking *Ten*\n       - *Wolves* slaughtering *Eight*\n   - I really struggle to believe this one isn't evil.\n - {🔟, 2️⃣}🪦🐺 **Twelve**: I believe in Two's dig of them as a SS.\n - {🔟, 3️⃣} ~~**Thirteen**: 👁️~~\n - {🔟, 4️⃣}🪦 **Fourteen**: Probably killed by opposing evil team to the one that killed Nine (first time).","GameId":"smg-322","TimeStamp":"2025-09-05T15:50:06.8688006Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"emilis","Message":"Reformatted it to make it easier to read","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"09b844ec-08d6-42d6-8548-c67234f31d24","PlayersIdentity":"Four","GameId":"smg-322","TimeStamp":"2025-09-05T15:50:19.4539681Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"PapaSmurf","Message":"That’s a possibility sure.
