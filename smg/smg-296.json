Has jokes. I've seen proof they're a villiager. Result: **Hard Lit** Vanilliger Claim.\n \n* **Clown**: Scary avatar, but so far, I have no susses on Clown. He was quick to joke about being eaten quickly, which didn’t happen. Could be because he’s a wolf, could be because the wolves thought we would think he was a wolf if they didn’t eat him. Blacksmith claim is unexpected. Bold play if they’re a wolf. Result: **Soft lit**\n \n* **Annie**: Is she OK? Helpful in discussions, Claims to be a villager with an Item, which is unique so far in this setup. Will need to know what Item she has to further judge. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **JonStewart**: Seems to have a bit of a translation barrier, but he tries. New player, I think, otherwise he’s playing it off well. Seems unfamiliar with mechanics/roles, so I’m trying not to judge some of his statements too harshly as a sus, but more as a lack of knowledge. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **TerryCrews**: Has been helpful in discussions, though I would like to see him more active throughout the day. Another Vanilliger claim.\n \n* **Sooty**: Avatar is too cute to survive this long without protection. Soft sus for that. Seems to agree with other people’s opinions more than adding their own, but is active and answers when asked questions. Could just be an agreeable person. Result: **Soft Sus** Another Vanilliger claim. \n \n* **Sabretooth, AKA Sabretits**: Active in conversations after D2. Opinions often align with my own. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **Elliot**: Less active, but helpful when they show up. Hard to get a read on them. Soft sus because it feels like they are lying low. Result: **Soft Sus** Another Vanilliger Claim. \n\n* **Leeroy**: Less active than I'd like. Weird vibes on D2, but showed up before nightfall and has seemed fine since then. Claimed GD. Checks seem lit. Lycan dig lines up with Mort's Wolf Pelt and their D1 drunk seer dig for thematic purposes. Possible BH, but to me Result: **Soft lit**\n\n* **Swanson**: Keep an eye on him. Visited {Dove,Dove} N2, same as kill, though he did claim {leaving} which isn't a wolfy thing to do. Active and helpful. Result: **Soft lit (but need to watch them more)**\n\n* **Mortimer**: Oh, Morty… He's been my tinfoil since D2, but despite that I feel like he's lit. He's helpful in conversations and actively investigates daily events. Very villiger-y. Too bad he keeps getting blocked or I could make a decision on him, maybe.

Has jokes. I've seen proof they're a villiager. Result: **Hard Lit** Vanilliger Claim.\n \n* **Clown**: Scary avatar, but so far, I have no susses on Clown. He was quick to joke about being eaten quickly, which didn’t happen. Could be because he’s a wolf, could be because the wolves thought we would think he was a wolf if they didn’t eat him. Blacksmith claim is unexpected. Bold play if they’re a wolf. Result: **Soft lit**\n \n* **Annie**: Is she OK? Helpful in discussions, Claims to be a villager with an Item, which is unique so far in this setup. Will need to know what Item she has to further judge. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **JonStewart**: Seems to have a bit of a translation barrier, but he tries. New player, I think, otherwise he’s playing it off well. Seems unfamiliar with mechanics/roles, so I’m trying not to judge some of his statements too harshly as a sus, but more as a lack of knowledge. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **TerryCrews**: Has been helpful in discussions, though I would like to see him more active throughout the day. Another Vanilliger claim.\n \n* **Sooty**: Avatar is too cute to survive this long without protection. Soft sus for that. Seems to agree with other people’s opinions more than adding their own, but is active and answers when asked questions. Could just be an agreeable person. Result: **Soft Sus** Another Vanilliger claim. \n \n* **Sabretooth, AKA Sabretits**: Active in conversations after D2. Opinions often align with my own. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **Elliot**: I don't remember seeing them say much, but they were helpful when they did. Hard to get a read on them. Arcane watcher check seemed useful and aligned with the other checks. Very defensive over a summary mistake and an opinion based from memory, but that's ok. \n\n* **Leeroy**: Less active than I'd like. Weird vibes on D2, but showed up before nightfall and has seemed fine since then. Claimed GD. Checks seem lit. Lycan dig lines up with Mort's Wolf Pelt and their D1 drunk seer dig for thematic purposes. Possible BH, but to me Result: **Soft lit**\n\n* **Swanson**: Keep an eye on him. Visited {Dove,Dove} N2, same as kill, though he did claim {leaving} which isn't a wolfy thing to do. Active and helpful. Result: **Soft lit (but need to watch them more)**\n\n* **Mortimer**: Oh, Morty… He's been my tinfoil since D2, but despite that I feel like he's lit. He's helpful in conversations and actively investigates daily events. Very villiger-y. Too bad he keeps getting blocked or I could make a decision on him, maybe.

Has jokes. I've seen proof they're a villiager. Result: **Hard Lit** Vanilliger Claim.\n \n* **Clown**: Scary avatar, but so far, I have no susses on Clown. He was quick to joke about being eaten quickly, which didn’t happen. Could be because he’s a wolf, could be because the wolves thought we would think he was a wolf if they didn’t eat him. Blacksmith claim is unexpected. Bold play if they’re a wolf. Result: **Soft lit**\n \n* **Annie**: Is she OK? Helpful in discussions, Claims to be a villager with an Item, which is unique so far in this setup. Will need to know what Item she has to further judge. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **JonStewart**: Seems to have a bit of a translation barrier, but he tries. New player, I think, otherwise he’s playing it off well. Seems unfamiliar with mechanics/roles, so I’m trying not to judge some of his statements too harshly as a sus, but more as a lack of knowledge. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **TerryCrews**: Has been helpful in discussions, though I would like to see him more active throughout the day. Another Vanilliger claim.\n \n* **Sooty**: Avatar is too cute to survive this long without protection. Soft sus for that. Seems to agree with other people’s opinions more than adding their own, but is active and answers when asked questions. Could just be an agreeable person. Result: **Soft Sus** Another Vanilliger claim. \n \n* **Sabretooth, AKA Sabretits**: Active in conversations starting D2. Opinions often align with my own. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **Elliot**: I don't remember seeing them say much, but they were helpful when they did. Hard to get a read on them. Arcane watcher check seemed useful and aligned with the other checks. Very defensive over a summary mistake and an opinion based from memory, but that's ok. \n\n* **Leeroy**: Less active than I'd like. Weird vibes on D2, but showed up before nightfall and has seemed fine since then. Claimed GD. Checks seem lit. Lycan dig lines up with Mort's Wolf Pelt and their D1 drunk seer dig for thematic purposes. Possible BH, but to me Result: **Soft lit**\n\n* **Swanson**: Keep an eye on him. Visited {Dove,Dove} N2, same as kill, though he did claim {leaving} which isn't a wolfy thing to do. Active and helpful. Result: **Soft lit (but need to watch them more)**\n\n* **Mortimer**: Oh, Morty… He's been my tinfoil since D2, but despite that I feel like he's lit. He's helpful in conversations and actively investigates daily events. Very villiger-y. Too bad he keeps getting blocked or I could make a decision on him, maybe.

Has jokes. I've seen proof they're a villiager. Result: **Hard Lit** Vanilliger Claim.\n \n* **Clown**: Scary avatar, but so far, I have no susses on Clown. He was quick to joke about being eaten quickly, which didn’t happen. Could be because he’s a wolf, could be because the wolves thought we would think he was a wolf if they didn’t eat him. Blacksmith claim is unexpected. Bold play if they’re a wolf. Result: **Soft lit**\n \n* **Annie**: Is she OK? Helpful in discussions, Claims to be a villager with an Item, which is unique so far in this setup. Will need to know what Item she has to further judge. Another Vanilliger claim.\n\n* **JonStewart**: Seems to have a bit of a translation barrier, but he tries. New player, I think, otherwise he’s playing it off well. Seems unfamiliar with mechanics/roles, so I’m trying not to judge some of his statements too harshly as a sus, but more as a lack of knowledge. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **TerryCrews**: Has been helpful in discussions, though I would like to see him more active throughout the day. Another Vanilliger claim.\n \n* **Sooty**: Avatar is too cute to survive this long without protection. Soft sus for that. Seems to agree with other people’s opinions more than adding their own, but is active and answers when asked questions. Could just be an agreeable person. Result: **Soft Sus** Another Vanilliger claim. \n \n* **Sabretooth, AKA Sabretits**: Active in conversations starting D2. Opinions often align with my own. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **Elliot**: I don't remember seeing them say much, but they were helpful when they did. Hard to get a read on them. Arcane watcher check seemed useful and aligned with the other checks. Very defensive over a summary mistake and an opinion based from memory, but that's ok. \n\n* **Leeroy**: Less active than I'd like. Weird vibes on D2, but showed up before nightfall and has seemed fine since then. Claimed GD. Checks seem lit. Lycan dig lines up with Mort's Wolf Pelt and their D1 drunk seer dig for thematic purposes. Possible BH, but to me Result: **Soft lit**\n\n* **Swanson**: Keep an eye on him. Visited {Dove,Dove} N2, same as kill, though he did claim {leaving} which isn't a wolfy thing to do. Active and helpful. Result: **Soft lit (but need to watch them more)**\n\n* **Mortimer**: Oh, Morty… He's been my tinfoil since D2, but despite that I feel like he's lit. He's helpful in conversations and actively investigates daily events. Very villiger-y. Too bad he keeps getting blocked or I could make a decision on him, maybe. Result: **Soft lit, but also tinfoil sus**\n\n* **Other observations**: I still don't think Prime was a shift, Though I'm not sure why AW would waste second kill on a lycan. Possible that Prime was MS or ML and failed a recruit.","GameId":"smg-296","TimeStamp":"2023-11-11T17:00:40.7302549Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"XuonA","Message":"Yes the nearby was Clown making some cool item right?","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"110da5b6-5199-42eb-9753-d1a46026c146","PlayersIdentity":"Sooty","GameId":"smg-296","TimeStamp":"2023-11-11T17:01:06.842079Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Merlin_Brum","Message":"Unless I get proven wrong about my take on the N2","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"51050809-0438-42d7-a412-92f125c94bd5","PlayersIdentity":"Swanson","GameId":"smg-296","TimeStamp":"2023-11-11T17:01:08.1858379Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Merlin_Brum","Message":"Yes Clown with self visit","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"b8d56b89-f6f2-4270-8682-a85f206f916b","PlayersIdentity":"Swanson","GameId":"smg-296","TimeStamp":"2023-11-11T17:01:17.9359572Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"XuonA","Message":"So that leaves 1 incoming and 1 outgoing","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"f5f9b5c5-7b29-4a48-9934-ccfe14f3329c","PlayersIdentity":"Sooty","GameId":"smg-296","TimeStamp":"2023-11-11T17:01:20.4674171Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Merlin_Brum","Message":"So 1 incoming and 1 outgoing missing","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"b007bbb0-aa76-49ea-a851-4ed8cf288604","PlayersIdentity":"Swanson","GameId":"smg-296","TimeStamp":"2023-11-11T17:01:24.4880626Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationRetractedEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","Target":"sia2022","PlayerName":"Lucky","GameId":"smg-296","TimeStamp":"2023-11-11T17:01:33.3698195Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Lucky","Target":"XuonA","TotalVotesForPlayer":4,"GameId":"smg-296","TimeStamp":"2023-11-11T17:01:33.3698221Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"XuonA","Message":"The incoming is somebody sniffing someone?","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"65345e48-332b-4b16-be80-e3aa2cbc08fe","PlayersIdentity":"Sooty","GameId":"smg-296","TimeStamp":"2023-11-11T17:01:37.1116619Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"XuonA","Message":"And then the outgoing is between Annie and Wolfgang","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"a7011792-6c8e-41a1-a6d0-9118a19539ab","PlayersIdentity":"Sooty","GameId":"smg-296","TimeStamp":"2023-11-11T17:01:58.7628257Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.PlayersVoteReasonGiven, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Lucky","Target":"XuonA","Message":"Main sus, will change if it’s gonna be at a snipe position.

Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Gnomish","Summary":"# **Summary** \n \n* **Wolfgang**: Helpful guy. Has jokes. I've seen proof they're a villiager. Result: **Hard Lit** Vanilliger Claim.\n \n* **Clown**: Scary avatar, but so far, I have no susses on Clown. He was quick to joke about being eaten quickly, which didn’t happen. Could be because he’s a wolf, could be because the wolves thought we would think he was a wolf if they didn’t eat him. Blacksmith claim is unexpected. Bold play if they’re a wolf. Result: **Soft lit**\n \n* **Annie**: Is she OK? Helpful in discussions, Claims to be a villager with an Item, which is unique so far in this setup. Will need to know what Item she has to further judge. Another Vanilliger claim.\n\n* **JonStewart**: Seems to have a bit of a translation barrier, but he tries. New player, I think, otherwise he’s playing it off well. Seems unfamiliar with mechanics/roles, so I’m trying not to judge some of his statements too harshly as a sus, but more as a lack of knowledge. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **TerryCrews**: Has been helpful in discussions, though I would like to see him more active throughout the day. Another Vanilliger claim.\n \n* **Sooty**: Avatar is too cute to survive this long without protection. Soft sus for that. Seems to agree with other people’s opinions more than adding their own, but is active and answers when asked questions. Could just be an agreeable person. Result: **Soft Sus** Another Vanilliger claim. \n \n* **Sabretooth, AKA Sabretits**: Active in conversations starting D2. Opinions often align with my own. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **Elliot**: I don't remember seeing them say much, but they were helpful when they did. Hard to get a read on them. Arcane watcher check seemed useful and aligned with the other checks. Very defensive over a summary mistake and an opinion based from memory, but that's ok. Rune claim is too wild to be faked. Feels real and villiger-y. Result **Soft lit**\n\n* **Leeroy**: Less active than I'd like. Weird vibes on D2, but showed up before nightfall and has seemed fine since then. Claimed GD. Checks seem lit. Lycan dig lines up with Mort's Wolf Pelt and their D1 drunk seer dig for thematic purposes. Possible BH, but to me Result: **Soft lit**\n\n* **Swanson**: Keep an eye on him. Visited {Dove,Dove} N2, same as kill, though he did claim {leaving} which isn't a wolfy thing to do. Active and helpful. Result: **Soft lit (but need to watch them more)**\n\n* **Mortimer**: Oh, Morty… He's been my tinfoil since D2, but despite that I feel like he's lit. He's helpful in conversations and actively investigates daily events. Very villiger-y. Too bad he keeps getting blocked or I could make a decision on him, maybe.

Has jokes. I've seen proof they're a villiager. Result: **Hard Lit** Vanilliger Claim.\n \n* **Clown**: Scary avatar, but so far, I have no susses on Clown. He was quick to joke about being eaten quickly, which didn’t happen. Could be because he’s a wolf, could be because the wolves thought we would think he was a wolf if they didn’t eat him. Blacksmith claim is unexpected. Bold play if they’re a wolf. Result: **Soft lit**\n \n* **Annie**: Is she OK? Helpful in discussions, Claims to be a villager with an Item, which is unique so far in this setup. Rune claim is too wild to be faked. Feels real and villiger-y. Result **Soft lit**\n\n* **JonStewart**: Seems to have a bit of a translation barrier, but he tries. New player, I think, otherwise he’s playing it off well. Seems unfamiliar with mechanics/roles, so I’m trying not to judge some of his statements too harshly as a sus, but more as a lack of knowledge. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **TerryCrews**: Has been helpful in discussions, though I would like to see him more active throughout the day. Another Vanilliger claim.\n \n* **Sooty**: Avatar is too cute to survive this long without protection. Soft sus for that. Seems to agree with other people’s opinions more than adding their own, but is active and answers when asked questions. Could just be an agreeable person. Result: **Soft Sus** Another Vanilliger claim. \n \n* **Sabretooth, AKA Sabretits**: Active in conversations starting D2. Opinions often align with my own. Another Vanilliger claim. \n\n* **Elliot**: I don't remember seeing them say much, but they were helpful when they did. Hard to get a read on them. Arcane watcher check seemed useful and aligned with the other checks. Very defensive over a summary mistake and an opinion based from memory, but that's ok. \n\n* **Leeroy**: Less active than I'd like. Weird vibes on D2, but showed up before nightfall and has seemed fine since then. Claimed GD. Checks seem lit. Lycan dig lines up with Mort's Wolf Pelt and their D1 drunk seer dig for thematic purposes. Possible BH, but to me Result: **Soft lit**\n\n* **Swanson**: Keep an eye on him. Visited {Dove,Dove} N2, same as kill, though he did claim {leaving} which isn't a wolfy thing to do. Active and helpful. Result: **Soft lit (but need to watch them more)**\n\n* **Mortimer**: Oh, Morty… He's been my tinfoil since D2, but despite that I feel like he's lit. He's helpful in conversations and actively investigates daily events. Very villiger-y. Too bad he keeps getting blocked or I could make a decision on him, maybe. Result: **Soft lit, but also tinfoil sus**\n\n* **Other observations**: I still don't think Prime was a shift, Though I'm not sure why AW would waste second kill on a lycan. Possible that Prime was MS or ML and failed a recruit.","GameId":"smg-296","TimeStamp":"2023-11-11T18:01:15.0663602Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Mark_T","Message":"I think that one was a genuine mistake, however I still think you're making up your susses","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"3fc44629-8bca-4d3f-a466-f5ca60667791","PlayersIdentity":"Elliot","GameId":"smg-296","TimeStamp":"2023-11-11T18:01:25.9530887Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"XuonA","Message":"At this moment I am not sure how I can change the sus people have on me.

Ok so lets tart with the dots and the rest of those: The game has changed a lot since day 2, while day 2 was mostly people voicing their opinion spread over the day. In contrast the  last few days there is much more direct discussion going on between people in a more interactive manner. I had heavy meta on day 2, there is a very limited sample size on scenarios I'd react to or comment on. In addition the mood of the game has changed a lot with the direct conflicts going on. You're pretending there is a huge amount of text to read up on me, while it's actually quite basic and limited. On Jon: It's not true that Prime and I interact with Jon in the same manner. Prime was attacking Jon for not giving any opinions, I obviously had to discuss their sus on me yesterday. You can't expect me to thank Jon for his opinion. They were voting me and I had to defend myself, this is much different to Prime attacking Jon day 2. Jons opinion on the shift was not well reasoned and thus I wanted clarification so I can defend myself. This for me is a very dishonest argument to be made to make up ANY connection between me and Prime. Besides in this game people will interact with other and disagree on things. I think this kind of sus on me is a testament for how flimsy the case is towards me.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"fb5d480d-b247-4b4d-b9ac-36e92196aa52","PlayersIdentity":"Clown","GameId":"smg-296","TimeStamp":"2023-11-13T19:28:33.2809091Z","RequiredUpToDay":6},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"XuonA","Message":"The case might be flimsy.

I agree with you that the conflict Prime/Jon and Clown/Jon where on very different subjects, but it is the way those arguments went and the way there was spoken that feel similiar to me. They sound like the same person, even tough the argument was because of different things. Also, still I think that even though your day might be heavy meta filled or the conversations that are being held can be different, the way you use your interpunctions are something that are just personal. So if you are used to close sentences with a dot, exclamation mark or question mark it something you will fall back to when things might get heated. And I know, it might be the little things, but also the little things mather. And in this case I absolutely think they matter even more.

I didn't want to go too crazy, but I also wanted to put in some bits and pieces that might be tricky for players. The Drunk Seer with the shield was intended to be a personal problem for the player. They could protect themselves, but lose a check if they did, while knowing that their check might be drunk anyway. It doesn't make sense immediately, but if you can get the Wolves to waste a kill on you with the shield, then that's as powerful as a check, imo. Anyway, Diablo didn't use it and was drunk and immediately died, so lol. The Stalker had the pelt as protection, but would make them flag as Wolf to the Seer and should give BMC paranoia. The Beholder was strong here, in that they can still see the drunk checks of the DS and can help confirm the Stalker as not a Wolf. I know Beholders aren't used a lot anymore, so putting that in was to make people think about unusual roles and that it might just be BS because it isn't really a wlf role. The Blind Monk is a ridiculously strong role, but would get weaker as the game went on because the Wolves had the staff to spellbound people. The spellbound would also hell to weaken the Stalker. GD obviously was there to help try and sort stuff out. I put the rune on the sleepwalker as a hint towards spellbound that they might figure out, but gave them the wrong frigging rune boo hiss.
