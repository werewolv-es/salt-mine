But it can, Akita hinted that to me accidentally, haha ;) The only good thing is: Now I can STILL enrage again I think.  ------ ENTIRE strategy for night 4: 1. American blocks Fox (Protector); this has 50% chance of failing though bc American is poisoned!! 2. StBernard has to take our KILL from now on because I am still poisoned. -> Akita. Keep in mind Akita has 50% chance of surviving (if American fails to block Protector), and a lot of Stalker-roles will follow him and Fox tonight, so StBernard might get blamed for killing Akita!! (Still worth trying, though.)  3. I will try to kill Fox (Protector) with Enrage (50% chance that my \"Berserk\" fails again; and even higher chance Fox protects himself instead of Akita.)   If it works, I might get seen & lynched by Village. WHAT should I answer them as an excuse then?? No idea.  Probably I should enrage-kill a different target instead? One of the \"silent but not entirely AFK\" wolves? Then it is unlikely that I will be seen, and if so I could claim it to be Militia-shot... BUT I might accidentally kill a CULT. And the silent wolves are not really dangerous to us currently.  ------ 4. Shapeshift should NOT be used at all: Always save that until StBernard himself gets heavily sussed. Never use Shapeshift otherwise, it would only make us MORE sus! And: I will continue saying I am Militia & safe my shot. I will claim shooting YOU (StBenard) after you get suspected by the village, the same night you use Shapeshift, bc that ability looks like you died!! Two problems solved at once. ;) ---- 5. Problem: What to do if Akira survives? IMO this strategy is safe enough though. Maybe throw blood on Akita in addition if we don't find a better target? ---- 6. POODLE: Try to find CULT members, our allies. We currently have no clue who they are, some of them are probably dead now? And announce it to us during the day by something like, example:  If your checked role is a good village role (very likely), write something like \"sorry I am busy\" in the chat during the day. Then you can go AFK again without anyone suspecting you! ;)  But if your checked role (at morning) is a CULT role, write something like \"morning\", or choose something better yourself now? Here is the full list of potential CULT roles (but I expect us to have only ~3 in this game):  https://unofficialhowtoplay.co.uk/index.php/Bloodmoon_Cult ------- PROBLEM with this strategy: If almost all of us go to Akita & Fox in 1 night, we risk exposing ALL of our wolves to Intel roles and putting some accusations on us that we are a group. Risky. (Except for StBernard who can Shapeshit, but that is extremely hard to roleplayed, so should not be used at all.) ---- ---- ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY NUMBER 2:  StBernard kills Fox (because Fox will most likely protect Akita instead) ---- Only American goes to Akita (try to block Seer, 50%). => American MIGHT get sussed being Werewolf trying to kill, failing bc of Protector -> but American could still claim to be an Intelligence role who can visit? To check if Akita REALLY is a Seer? Legit enough. --- I will always enrage. Killing a target which has barely spoken and is silent (or ideally Sharpei cause confirmed village by Akita, but I might get seen there. Unlikely though). --- We should maybe NOT put blood on Akita tonight (or should we?), bc hes smart enough to immediately confirm Bloodletter then, and maybe even someone sees Dachs visiting Akita then. --- POODLE: Same as above, under \"6.\"","Recipients":["LucentTiara","spongebobepic","Alena","Wehrwolf","LarsTheOnly1"],"Eavesdroppers":[],"GameId":"smc-481","TimeStamp":"2025-02-16T20:02:35.026061Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.WerewolfNightMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Wehrwolf","Message":"god damn, that copy paste REMOVED LINE BREAKS!!

He claimed Seer yesterday, but did not die tonight. That Protector claim yesterday (from Fox) also came out of nowhere, on the same day Akita claimed Seer!! Slightly sus. Fox could have stayed hidden. I am willing to trust Fox for now and give him a fair chance, but if he + Akita are wolves, it would be an incredible smart move to fake-claim Protector to explain in advance why a (Wolf) Seer will survive another night. ------- 2. Akita made 4 Seer claims so far: Me = Wolf (which I obviously know is false), Pug = Village (likely false, I gave >5 reasons why Pug is sus, e.g. he claimed he is Diseased and can poison Wolves (wrong) who try to kill AND still survives if attacked, all of that is wrong) --- He claimed SharPei is village, which Akita knows is hard to disprove since SharPei has been mostly AFK and joking around the first days, could be anything. ---- Claimed German = Wolf, who had decently good reputation before, see the last 2 days chats. ---------------------------------------- 3. Akita seems very smart & easily able to pull off a Fake Seer in theory.  --------- 4. Akita was the FIRST one to mention \"Bloodletter\" role yesterday, so there is a high chance he is the Bloodletter Wolf himself, marking me & German with blood (fake Wolves) before accusing us, just to be extra sure that his accusations won't be disproven by others, and hinting Village at himself for reverse psychology. Again a weird \"overplay\" of his role, but can work. -----------------------  5. Akita denied the existence of \"Cult Assassin\" yesterday (an ally of Wolves), who is by far the most likely explanation for the poisons: Check wiki under \"Poison\" and \"Cult Assassin\": \"Can poison 1 target every night, wins with the Wolves\". So this is a strong proof me + American are village (or at least the Cult believes that), but when I mentioned Assassin yesterday, Akita said something very weird like: \"That role is not even in the Wiki\"","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"751f62aa-5246-4ff1-9b62-a3961bc4566c","PlayersIdentity":"Chihuahua","GameId":"smc-481","TimeStamp":"2025-02-17T10:44:17.8453997Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Wehrwolf","Message":"https://unofficialhowtoplay.co.uk/index.php/Cult_Assassin","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"c1df1404-71eb-4f99-89e7-80bbfd778f32","PlayersIdentity":"Chihuahua","GameId":"smc-481","TimeStamp":"2025-02-17T10:44:39.9304146Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Wehrwolf","Message":"https://unofficialhowtoplay.co.uk/index.php/Poisoned","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"1f768f8c-6f9b-4383-8fca-0711a4ca8fae","PlayersIdentity":"Chihuahua","GameId":"smc-481","TimeStamp":"2025-02-17T10:44:59.4395279Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Wehrwolf","Message":"(Wulfkin are NOT in match, not announced at game start.
