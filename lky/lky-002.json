He says he did not use the vibra rune N1 because he thought the intel was irrelevant for him at the time and he wante to wait a night to see if stuff would happen (I assume by that he meant to get a better read on people and then choose to use it).

He said there was not much going on besides him being a neutral swiss person, a graverobber with a vibra rune which is in evil hands now and that rollin' said they were a prot and that he was online a few minutes before nightfall. He goes on to say that he saw there was a psychic claim but truth be told he does not have a lot of info to give. He says he did not use the vibra rune N1 because he thought the intel was irrelevant for him at the time and he wante to wait a night to see if stuff would happen (I assume by that he meant to get a better read on people and then choose to use it).

I wanted roles to get too lit (Mason, Reviver, DH, Spellweaver and so on). Intel came from DH, NTR and the Spellweaver. In hindsight the vamp might have been too OP, but it‚Äôs hard with 12 players. It would also have mattered who the RNG made vamp. Vamp had an amazing recruit with the NTR, and since the DH pogot and then got blocked‚Ä¶ no intel there. So it became pretty much useless intel. Fun fact: The NTR checked the damned and the King on N1 and got the most boring cards and A RANDOM HOUND CARD. This was so frustrating, it could have been so interesting xD. I think everyone has played very well, but Ginger and Baby really formed a solid lit evil team, which made the setup work.
