\n| Lanford (Unknown) | \n\n# Diary of Suspects\n\n* ### Laurel\n* * *Yesterday I had the following conversation with her:*\n* * * *Laurel: Do lky games tend to be slow and drawn out?*\n* * * *Lanford: Not really*\n* * * *Laurel: I don't really see a zealot game in a game with high killpower, but trends are meant to broken :)*\n* * * *Lanford: How do you know we will have high killpower though?*\n* * * *Laurel: Well you said they're not usually long and drawn out*\n* * *And today not only have there been two deaths, but also a claimed killer who says he has not killed yet. MHM LAUREL.*\n* * *In all seriousness, I realise all this could just be a coincidence on her part, but I am not dropping my suspicions just yet.*\n*\n* ### Connor\n* * *The acclaimed killer who has not killed yet and is in an Arcanist check with Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è that says they have **a difference of dove**. Naturally this has made me think he could be a possible Alphawolf or whatever gets an extra kill.*\n* * *On the flip side, he had the false idea that as long as both players have a dove anywhere, there should not be a difference in dove and with that in mind he seemed genuinely surprised when ~~our Arcanist~~ one of our Arcanists said there was a difference in dove. Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?! Dove is mine lol, so how did cold ass (Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è) die then?*\n*\n* * *Addendum: On further thought, Connor is more and more sus as the day goes by. He asked for cards from Todd who obliged and claimed dove, dove, magician. Connor however did not oblige to explain why he asked for the cards, leaving all of us in a state of perplexity.*","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-22T18:42:36.8764193Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationRetractedEvent,

\n| Lanford (Unknown) | \n\n# Diary of Suspects\n\n* ### Laurel\n* * *Yesterday I had the following conversation with her:*\n* * * *Laurel: Do lky games tend to be slow and drawn out?*\n* * * *Lanford: Not really*\n* * * *Laurel: I don't really see a zealot game in a game with high killpower, but trends are meant to broken :)*\n* * * *Lanford: How do you know we will have high killpower though?*\n* * * *Laurel: Well you said they're not usually long and drawn out*\n* * *And today not only have there been two deaths, but also a claimed killer who says he has not killed yet. MHM LAUREL.*\n* * *In all seriousness, I realise all this could just be a coincidence on her part, but I am not dropping my suspicions just yet.*\n*\n* ### Connor\n* * *The acclaimed killer who has not killed yet and is in an Arcanist check with Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è that says they have **a difference of dove**. Naturally this has made me think he could be a possible Alphawolf or whatever gets an extra kill.*\n* * *On the flip side, he had the false idea that as long as both players have a dove anywhere, there should not be a difference in dove and with that in mind he seemed genuinely surprised when ~~our Arcanist~~ one of our Arcanists said there was a difference in dove. Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?! Dove is mine lol, so how did cold ass (Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è) die then?*\n*\n* * *Addendum: On further thought, Connor is more and more sus as the day goes by. He asked for cards from Todd who obliged and claimed dove, dove, magician. Connor however did not oblige to explain why he asked for the cards, leaving all of us in a state of perplexity.*","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-22T19:17:58.5899121Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ImTownSRSLY","Message":"@ConnorWalsh I don't fully get why you wanted this card, you knew the answer.","MentionedIdentities":["ConnorWalsh"],"MentionedPlayers":["Merlin_Brum"],"MessageId":"73518901-fafe-45d0-889a-ae0d1287adc8","PlayersIdentity":"EmmettCrawford","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-22T19:18:01.812624Z","RequiredUpToDay":2},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"BSam","Message":"Not sure what i should think about it..

Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?!

(Unknown) | \n\n# Diary of Suspects\n\n* ### Tegan\n* * *She claimed Arcanist and seemed to have known that Connor is a killer which indicates she is lit, but the revived Nate claims Bonnie is a MS that died failing to recruit Tegan (on N1?) (Also isn't this something you say asap? He kinda waited)*\n\n* ### Laurel\n* * *Yesterday (D1) I had the following conversation with her:*\n* * * *Laurel: Do lky games tend to be slow and drawn out?*\n* * * *Lanford: Not really*\n* * * *Laurel: I don't really see a zealot game in a game with high killpower, but trends are meant to broken :)*\n* * * *Lanford: How do you know we will have high killpower though?*\n* * * *Laurel: Well you said they're not usually long and drawn out*\n* * *And today not only have there been two deaths, but also a claimed killer who says he has not killed yet. MHM LAUREL.*\n* * *In all seriousness, I realise all this could just be a coincidence on her part, but I am not dropping my suspicions just yet.*\n* * *Addendum: Today (D3) we had 0 kills and a revive, I cannot sus Laurel anymore üò≠ (as much)*\n*\n* ### Connor\n* * *The acclaimed killer who has not killed yet and is in an Arcanist check with Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è that says they have **a difference of dove**. Naturally this has made me think he could be a possible Alphawolf or whatever gets an extra kill.*\n* * *On the flip side, he had the false idea that as long as both players have a dove anywhere, there should not be a difference in dove and with that in mind he seemed genuinely surprised when ~~our Arcanist~~ one of our Arcanists said there was a difference in dove. Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?! Dove is mine lol, so how did cold ass (Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è) die then?*\n*\n* * *1st Addendum: On further thought, Connor is more and more sus as the day goes by. He asked for cards from Todd who obliged and claimed dove, dove, magician. Connor however did not oblige to explain why he asked for the cards, leaving all of us in a state of perplexity.*\n* * *2nd Addendum: So, many, mags, why do we need a WH?*","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-23T12:55:59.9031605Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent,

MHM LAUREL.*\n* * *In all seriousness, I realise all this could just be a coincidence on her part, but I am not dropping my suspicions just yet.*\n* * *Addendum: Today (D3) we had 0 kills and a revive, I cannot sus Laurel anymore üò≠ (as much)*\n*\n* ### Connor\n* * *The acclaimed killer who has not killed yet and is in an Arcanist check with Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è that says they have **a difference of dove**. Naturally this has made me think he could be a possible Alphawolf or whatever gets an extra kill.*\n* * *On the flip side, he had the false idea that as long as both players have a dove anywhere, there should not be a difference in dove and with that in mind he seemed genuinely surprised when ~~our Arcanist~~ one of our Arcanists said there was a difference in dove. Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?! Dove is mine lol, so how did cold ass (Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è) die then?*\n*\n* * *1st Addendum: On further thought, Connor is more and more sus as the day goes by. He asked for cards from Todd who obliged and claimed dove, dove, magician. Connor however did not oblige to explain why he asked for the cards, leaving all of us in a state of perplexity.*\n* * *2nd Addendum: So, many, mags, why do we need a WH?*","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-23T17:12:37.2940803Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"PapaSmurf","Message":"‚Ä¶ and from his phone no less.

I feel like this is not the right play rn, and I think the voting reaction wont help for them to feel better about the situation. This is my fault that they are not feeling it, I think it's unfair to say that Connor is to blame for the situation that I caused. @ConnorWalsh I'm really sorry for what happened, I felt slightly insulted by your statement before and wanted to give a snidely response and it backfired hard. You were not acting like an eggplant nor should I have implied that in any way possible. I'm really sorry this happened and I hope we can talk it out post game if you want and everything. I'm truly truly sorry for what happened. / Emmet I would personally completely separate feelings that are personal from the information we have in the game.

seemed to have known that Connor is a killer which indicates she is lit, but the revived Nate claims Bonnie is a MS that died failing to recruit Tegan (on N1?) (Also isn't this something you say asap? He kinda waited)*\n\n* ### Laurel\n* * *Yesterday (D1) I had the following conversation with her:*\n* * * *Laurel: Do lky games tend to be slow and drawn out?*\n* * * *Lanford: Not really*\n* * * *Laurel: I don't really see a zealot game in a game with high killpower, but trends are meant to broken :)*\n* * * *Lanford: How do you know we will have high killpower though?*\n* * * *Laurel: Well you said they're not usually long and drawn out*\n* * *And today not only have there been two deaths, but also a claimed killer who says he has not killed yet. MHM LAUREL.*\n* * *In all seriousness, I realise all this could just be a coincidence on her part, but I am not dropping my suspicions just yet.*\n* * *Addendum: Today (D3) we had 0 kills and a revive, I cannot sus Laurel anymore üò≠ (as much)*\n*\n* ### Connor\n* * *The acclaimed killer who has not killed yet and is in an Arcanist check with Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è that says they have **a difference of dove**. Naturally this has made me think he could be a possible Alphawolf or whatever gets an extra kill.*\n* * *On the flip side, he had the false idea that as long as both players have a dove anywhere, there should not be a difference in dove and with that in mind he seemed genuinely surprised when ~~our Arcanist~~ one of our Arcanists said there was a difference in dove. Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?! Dove is mine lol, so how did cold ass (Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è) die then?*\n*\n* * *1st Addendum: On further thought, Connor is more and more sus as the day goes by. He asked for cards from Todd who obliged and claimed dove, dove, magician. Connor however did not oblige to explain why he asked for the cards, leaving all of us in a state of perplexity.*\n* * *2nd Addendum: So, many, mags, why do we need a

seemed to have known that Connor is a killer which indicates she is lit, but the revived Nate claims Bonnie is a MS that died failing to recruit Tegan (on N1?) (Also isn't this something you say asap? He kinda waited)*\n\n* ### Laurel\n* * *Yesterday (D1) I had the following conversation with her:*\n* * * *Laurel: Do lky games tend to be slow and drawn out?*\n* * * *Lanford: Not really*\n* * * *Laurel: I don't really see a zealot game in a game with high killpower, but trends are meant to broken :)*\n* * * *Lanford: How do you know we will have high killpower though?*\n* * * *Laurel: Well you said they're not usually long and drawn out*\n* * *And today not only have there been two deaths, but also a claimed killer who says he has not killed yet. MHM LAUREL.*\n* * *In all seriousness, I realise all this could just be a coincidence on her part, but I am not dropping my suspicions just yet.*\n* * *Addendum: Today (D3) we had 0 kills and a revive, I cannot sus Laurel anymore üò≠ (as much)*\n*\n* ### Connor\n* * *The acclaimed killer who has not killed yet and is in an Arcanist check with Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è that says they have **a difference of dove**. Naturally this has made me think he could be a possible Alphawolf or whatever gets an extra kill.*\n* * *On the flip side, he had the false idea that as long as both players have a dove anywhere, there should not be a difference in dove and with that in mind he seemed genuinely surprised when ~~our Arcanist~~ one of our Arcanists said there was a difference in dove. Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?! Dove is mine lol, so how did cold ass (Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è) die then?*\n*\n* * *1st Addendum: On further thought, Connor is more and more sus as the day goes by. He asked for cards from Todd who obliged and claimed dove, dove, magician. Connor however did not oblige to explain why he asked for the cards, leaving all of us in a state of perplexity.*\n* * *2nd Addendum: So, many, mags, why do we need a WH?*","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-23T19:12:43.0781535Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent,

(Also isn't this something you say asap? He kinda waited)*\n\n* ### Laurel\n* * *Yesterday (D1) I had the following conversation with her:*\n* * * *Laurel: Do lky games tend to be slow and drawn out?*\n* * * *Lanford: Not really*\n* * * *Laurel: I don't really see a zealot game in a game with high killpower, but trends are meant to broken :)*\n* * * *Lanford: How do you know we will have high killpower though?*\n* * * *Laurel: Well you said they're not usually long and drawn out*\n* * *And today not only have there been two deaths, but also a claimed killer who says he has not killed yet. MHM LAUREL.*\n* * *In all seriousness, I realise all this could just be a coincidence on her part, but I am not dropping my suspicions just yet.*\n* * *Addendum: Today (D3) we had 0 kills and a revive, I cannot sus Laurel anymore üò≠ (as much)*\n*\n* ### Connor\n* * *The acclaimed killer who has not killed yet and is in an Arcanist check with Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è that says they have **a difference of dove**. Naturally this has made me think he could be a possible Alphawolf or whatever gets an extra kill.*\n* * *On the flip side, he had the false idea that as long as both players have a dove anywhere, there should not be a difference in dove and with that in mind he seemed genuinely surprised when ~~our Arcanist~~ one of our Arcanists said there was a difference in dove. Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?! Dove is mine lol, so how did cold ass (Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è) die then?*\n*\n* * *1st Addendum: On further thought, Connor is more and more sus as the day goes by. He asked for cards from Todd who obliged and claimed dove, dove, magician. Connor however did not oblige to explain why he asked for the cards, leaving all of us in a state of perplexity.*\n* * *2nd Addendum: So, many, mags, why do we need a WH?*","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-23T19:42:29.5774257Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent,

(Also isn't this something you say asap? He kinda waited)*\n\n* ### Laurel\n* * *Yesterday (D1) I had the following conversation with her:*\n* * * *Laurel: Do lky games tend to be slow and drawn out?*\n* * * *Lanford: Not really*\n* * * *Laurel: I don't really see a zealot game in a game with high killpower, but trends are meant to broken :)*\n* * * *Lanford: How do you know we will have high killpower though?*\n* * * *Laurel: Well you said they're not usually long and drawn out*\n* * *And today not only have there been two deaths, but also a claimed killer who says he has not killed yet. MHM LAUREL.*\n* * *In all seriousness, I realise all this could just be a coincidence on her part, but I am not dropping my suspicions just yet.*\n* * *Addendum: Today (D3) we had 0 kills and a revive, I cannot sus Laurel anymore üò≠ (as much)*\n*\n* ### Connor\n* * *The acclaimed killer who has not killed yet and is in an Arcanist check with Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è that says they have **a difference of dove**. Naturally this has made me think he could be a possible Alphawolf or whatever gets an extra kill.*\n* * *On the flip side, he had the false idea that as long as both players have a dove anywhere, there should not be a difference in dove and with that in mind he seemed genuinely surprised when ~~our Arcanist~~ one of our Arcanists said there was a difference in dove. Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?! Dove is mine lol, so how did cold ass (Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è) die then?*\n*\n* * *1st Addendum: On further thought, Connor is more and more sus as the day goes by. He asked for cards from Todd who obliged and claimed dove, dove, magician. Connor however did not oblige to explain why he asked for the cards, leaving all of us in a state of perplexity.*\n* * *2nd Addendum: So, many, mags, why do we need a

(Also isn't this something you say asap? He kinda waited)*\n\n* ### Laurel\n* * *Yesterday (D1) I had the following conversation with her:*\n* * * *Laurel: Do lky games tend to be slow and drawn out?*\n* * * *Lanford: Not really*\n* * * *Laurel: I don't really see a zealot game in a game with high killpower, but trends are meant to broken :)*\n* * * *Lanford: How do you know we will have high killpower though?*\n* * * *Laurel: Well you said they're not usually long and drawn out*\n* * *And today not only have there been two deaths, but also a claimed killer who says he has not killed yet. MHM LAUREL.*\n* * *In all seriousness, I realise all this could just be a coincidence on her part, but I am not dropping my suspicions just yet.*\n* * *Addendum: Today (D3) we had 0 kills and a revive, I cannot sus Laurel anymore üò≠ (as much)*\n*\n* ### Connor\n* * *The acclaimed killer who has not killed yet and is in an Arcanist check with Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è that says they have **a difference of dove**. Naturally this has made me think he could be a possible Alphawolf or whatever gets an extra kill.*\n* * *On the flip side, he had the false idea that as long as both players have a dove anywhere, there should not be a difference in dove and with that in mind he seemed genuinely surprised when ~~our Arcanist~~ one of our Arcanists said there was a difference in dove. Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?! Dove is mine lol, so how did cold ass (Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è) die then?*\n*\n* * *1st Addendum: On further thought, Connor is more and more sus as the day goes by. He asked for cards from Todd who obliged and claimed dove, dove, magician. Connor however did not oblige to explain why he asked for the cards, leaving all of us in a state of perplexity.*\n* * *2nd Addendum: So, many, mags, why do we need a

MHM LAUREL.*\n* * *In all seriousness, I realise all this could just be a coincidence on her part, but I am not dropping my suspicions just yet.*\n* * *Addendum: Today (D3) we had 0 kills and a revive, I cannot sus Laurel anymore üò≠ (as much)*\n*\n* ### ~~Connor~~\n* * *The acclaimed killer who has not killed yet and is in an Arcanist check with Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è that says they have **a difference of dove**. Naturally this has made me think he could be a possible Alphawolf or whatever gets an extra kill.*\n* * *On the flip side, he had the false idea that as long as both players have a dove anywhere, there should not be a difference in dove and with that in mind he seemed genuinely surprised when ~~our Arcanist~~ one of our Arcanists said there was a difference in dove. Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?! Dove is mine lol, so how did cold ass (Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è) die then?*\n*\n* * *1st Addendum: On further thought, Connor is more and more sus as the day goes by. He asked for cards from Todd who obliged and claimed dove, dove, magician. Connor however did not oblige to explain why he asked for the cards, leaving all of us in a state of perplexity.*\n* * *2nd Addendum: So, many, mags, why do we need a WH?*\n*\n* ### ~~Tegan~~\n* * *She claimed Arcanist and seemed to have known that Connor is a killer which indicates she is lit, but the revived Nate claims Bonnie is a MS that died failing to recruit Tegan (on N1?) (Also isn't this something you say asap? He kinda waited)*","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T12:24:29.6634985Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Destry944","Message":"Okay I am back","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"d831e93d-cc8e-44b0-a8f4-de53986dcbf2","PlayersIdentity":"OliverHampton","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T12:24:33.4962281Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Destry944","Message":"I hope I can be PRESENT rm","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"3b326f07-dd63-4c13-b73f-e6af5eb74c8b","PlayersIdentity":"OliverHampton","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T12:24:38.8203822Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Destry944","Message":"Loads of meta sorry","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"e09b17c3-3d75-4b99-b6fd-66b12ae6e92f","PlayersIdentity":"OliverHampton","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T12:24:43.5562653Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Destry944","Message":"Rn*","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"ec5047bd-0dc8-4f7d-8422-5bd8fdd45912","PlayersIdentity":"OliverHampton","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T12:24:45.8111069Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Destry944","Message":"i need to read","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"7373a0dd-5465-4052-9017-3656e05f27c5","PlayersIdentity":"OliverHampton","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T12:24:58.8943638Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Destry944","Message":"I dont buy the Courtesan and NW combo.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"835bf73f-5f9b-42eb-b08f-41a004374631","PlayersIdentity":"OliverHampton","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T12:26:55.2236054Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Destry944","Message":"Honestly.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"ac5c5d5f-33ce-4688-a203-62bb20ec18aa","PlayersIdentity":"OliverHampton","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T12:26:57.3640801Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Destry944","Message":"I will forever sus it","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"e9709400-5f9f-464c-a1f6-f3d610504664","PlayersIdentity":"OliverHampton","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T12:27:03.7852134Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Destry944","Message":"Its quite possible sam is DW","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"3b930cbc-c617-4b49-96d7-ff71bb588da9","PlayersIdentity":"OliverHampton","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T12:27:11.0409467Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Destry944","Message":"the one thing i dont get it .. is NW magic?","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"a0214460-0df6-46ad-adf4-4a97bc5996dc","PlayersIdentity":"OliverHampton","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T12:27:34.9650575Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Destry944","Message":"And if we are FC-ing why dont I see claims from Lanford ?","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"ccd6551b-2c4d-4caf-8ec3-f71a21191bd9","PlayersIdentity":"OliverHampton","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T12:28:06.0380033Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Giovanniboyy","Message":"It's not.

MHM LAUREL.*\n* * *In all seriousness, I realise all this could just be a coincidence on her part, but I am not dropping my suspicions just yet.*\n* * *Addendum: Today (D3) we had 0 kills and a revive, I cannot sus Laurel anymore üò≠ (as much)*\n*\n* ### ~~Connor~~\n* * *The acclaimed killer who has not killed yet and is in an Arcanist check with Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è that says they have **a difference of dove**. Naturally this has made me think he could be a possible Alphawolf or whatever gets an extra kill.*\n* * *On the flip side, he had the false idea that as long as both players have a dove anywhere, there should not be a difference in dove and with that in mind he seemed genuinely surprised when ~~our Arcanist~~ one of our Arcanists said there was a difference in dove. Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?! Dove is mine lol, so how did cold ass (Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è) die then?*\n*\n* * *1st Addendum: On further thought, Connor is more and more sus as the day goes by. He asked for cards from Todd who obliged and claimed dove, dove, magician. Connor however did not oblige to explain why he asked for the cards, leaving all of us in a state of perplexity.*\n* * *2nd Addendum: So, many, mags, why do we need a WH?*\n*\n* ### ~~Tegan~~\n* * *She claimed Arcanist and seemed to have known that Connor is a killer which indicates she is lit, but the revived Nate claims Bonnie is a MS that died failing to recruit Tegan (on N1?) (Also isn't this something you say asap? He kinda waited)*","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T12:32:00.815672Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent,

MHM LAUREL.*\n* * *In all seriousness, I realise all this could just be a coincidence on her part, but I am not dropping my suspicions just yet.*\n* * *Addendum: Today (D3) we had 0 kills and a revive, I cannot sus Laurel anymore üò≠ (as much)*\n*\n* ### ~~Connor~~\n* * *The acclaimed killer who has not killed yet and is in an Arcanist check with Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è that says they have **a difference of dove**. Naturally this has made me think he could be a possible Alphawolf or whatever gets an extra kill.*\n* * *On the flip side, he had the false idea that as long as both players have a dove anywhere, there should not be a difference in dove and with that in mind he seemed genuinely surprised when ~~our Arcanist~~ one of our Arcanists said there was a difference in dove. Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?! Dove is mine lol, so how did cold ass (Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è) die then?*\n*\n* * *1st Addendum: On further thought, Connor is more and more sus as the day goes by. He asked for cards from Todd who obliged and claimed dove, dove, magician. Connor however did not oblige to explain why he asked for the cards, leaving all of us in a state of perplexity.*\n* * *2nd Addendum: So, many, mags, why do we need a WH?*\n*\n* ### ~~Tegan~~\n* * *She claimed Arcanist and seemed to have known that Connor is a killer which indicates she is lit, but the revived Nate claims Bonnie is a MS that died failing to recruit Tegan (on N1?) (Also isn't this something you say asap? He kinda waited)*","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T17:14:29.6824417Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationRetractedEvent,

MHM LAUREL.*\n* * *In all seriousness, I realise all this could just be a coincidence on her part, but I am not dropping my suspicions just yet.*\n* * *Addendum: Today (D3) we had 0 kills and a revive, I cannot sus Laurel anymore üò≠ (as much)*\n*\n* ### ~~Connor~~\n* * *The acclaimed killer who has not killed yet and is in an Arcanist check with Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è that says they have **a difference of dove**. Naturally this has made me think he could be a possible Alphawolf or whatever gets an extra kill.*\n* * *On the flip side, he had the false idea that as long as both players have a dove anywhere, there should not be a difference in dove and with that in mind he seemed genuinely surprised when ~~our Arcanist~~ one of our Arcanists said there was a difference in dove. Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?! Dove is mine lol, so how did cold ass (Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è) die then?*\n*\n* * *1st Addendum: On further thought, Connor is more and more sus as the day goes by. He asked for cards from Todd who obliged and claimed dove, dove, magician. Connor however did not oblige to explain why he asked for the cards, leaving all of us in a state of perplexity.*\n* * *2nd Addendum: So, many, mags, why do we need a WH?*\n*\n* ### ~~Tegan~~\n* * *She claimed Arcanist and seemed to have known that Connor is a killer which indicates she is lit, but the revived Nate claims Bonnie is a MS that died failing to recruit Tegan (on N1?) (Also isn't this something you say asap? He kinda waited)*","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T18:59:16.5438713Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent,

MHM LAUREL.*\n* * *In all seriousness, I realise all this could just be a coincidence on her part, but I am not dropping my suspicions just yet.*\n* * *Addendum: Today (D3) we had 0 kills and a revive, I cannot sus Laurel anymore üò≠ (as much)*\n*\n* ### ~~Connor~~\n* * *The acclaimed killer who has not killed yet and is in an Arcanist check with Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è that says they have **a difference of dove**. Naturally this has made me think he could be a possible Alphawolf or whatever gets an extra kill.*\n* * *On the flip side, he had the false idea that as long as both players have a dove anywhere, there should not be a difference in dove and with that in mind he seemed genuinely surprised when ~~our Arcanist~~ one of our Arcanists said there was a difference in dove. Would someone who knows they do not have a dove act so surprised about it? Here is that part of the conversation:*\n* * * *Connor: What?! Dove is mine lol, so how did cold ass (Bonnie‚úùÔ∏è) die then?*\n*\n* * *1st Addendum: On further thought, Connor is more and more sus as the day goes by. He asked for cards from Todd who obliged and claimed dove, dove, magician. Connor however did not oblige to explain why he asked for the cards, leaving all of us in a state of perplexity.*\n* * *2nd Addendum: So, many, mags, why do we need a WH?*\n*\n* ### ~~Tegan~~\n* * *She claimed Arcanist and seemed to have known that Connor is a killer which indicates she is lit, but the revived Nate claims Bonnie is a MS that died failing to recruit Tegan (on N1?) (Also isn't this something you say asap? He kinda waited)*","GameId":"lky-006","TimeStamp":"2024-07-24T19:03:37.7770796Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent,
