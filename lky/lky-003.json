Mike trusts Mrs Hudson, Holmes, Ella, Smallwood, Charles, Molly and maybe Edwin and is sus of Moriarty, Watson and Lestrade. Janine is inclined to agree on trusting Hudson, Ella, Charles and Molly. I find it strange if you‚Äôre (Edwin) lit, that you didn‚Äôt use or come out with the cleansing pot. Given that there haven‚Äôt been any poisons it seems that that pot was intended to cleanse some drunkyness? I also have a tunnel going on Elizabeth being Furie, since her claimed kills match up with the NT nights. If she does claim a kill tomorrow though, that goes out the window but puts her in a conflict with Mikes diseased reroll claim. My trouble with that tunnel is I can‚Äôt account for the Hound card in Sherlocks tarot card check, outside of a lycanthropy aura. I‚Äôm personally not onboard with Mrs Hudsons theory of Mike as Witch. If it is indeed coven as evils, he was very active in the theorycrafting on that subject down here, and has given me pretty lit vibes for what that‚Äôs worth ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I am inclined to be onboard with the coven as evil theory though.  Elizabeth is still my main sus. If we‚Äôre wrong, and it‚Äôs wolves, I agree that there‚Äôs too few kills if we take out two MW kills. And if it is coven I still think she‚Äôs a Furie.","Recipients":["PapaSmurf","Mark_T","Konim96","BSam"],"GameId":"lky-003","TimeStamp":"2024-06-19T20:48:45.6618183Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.GhostMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"PapaSmurf","Message":"I think that‚Äôs it for now.

Altho there seemed to have been some doubts that what they write will ever reach the surface (YOU DON'T TRUST ME JANINE?? BEHOLD)  # Notes from Janine Janine confirms the dig by Ella, her visits were n1 DrWatson and N2 Molly, both came back Village for obvious reasons. Janine said she very much appreciates Hudson for their biscuits (she misses them) and thinks that Hudson is doing a good job. They initially had slight suspicion on Hudson being BMC but they claim they'd be glad to be fooled by it if true. There seem to be no indication of BMC from anyone so that's out of the picture. Next point in her list is that apparently she had a Minor potion of incrimination and the trinket n1, she passed the pot to Mike and the trinket to Liz.Reason for Liz is her distrust in politicians... Reason for me was \"looked engaged day 2\". And obviously the fact she had to pass it... Liz thinks due the potion that there is most likely no BL present, she thinks Hudsons Coven theory could be true. She thinks the Greg lynch was the right decision but mostly due their poor argument and claim, she is very sad that the reviver claim came so late and forced, thus denying them any chance of being revived. (there seems to be a discussion here between Janine and Greg?, <insert small potential NO U here>, while she was typing the summary I THINK Greg tuned in to say something about them being lit yadda yadda and Janine responds to that ). She's sceptical of Charles being another seer and then piling Jim of top of that. In her mind the number of seer-type roles it too high.  So in her mind Jim or Charles are lying. She also suspects Mike of being coven of some kind due to the role change. She makes a not here that Mike does not agree with this assumption but it seems Mike did not object during the summary as much as Greg. Altho there is some discussion going on after it, but nothing definitive enough for me to give a proper account on who she talked to and what exactly it was about.   Bill claims beholder that was blocked n1 and saw nothing n2 when beholding Ella night 2. Janine says she redacted some of the thoughts poor Bill had about being eaten N2 by liz for \"apparently no reason besides being blocked\", which upset them because they obviously can't do much about it. Janine was nice enough tho to describe the words with their starting letters: i, m, f and s . There's a note that I should make clear that this were no personal attacks but just their opinion about the play to eat them.  Bill is more on the wolves train and finds it possible that Liz is just straight up evil (I mean he's totally not biased). Janine asked bill for his items during the summary but when I'm writing this got no response yet, I'll check in the morning if there's more (see addendum).

Janine said she very much appreciates Hudson for their biscuits (she misses them) and thinks that Hudson is doing a good job. They initially had slight suspicion on Hudson being BMC but they claim they'd be glad to be fooled by it if true. There seem to be no indication of BMC from anyone so that's out of the picture. Next point in her list is that apparently she had a Minor potion of incrimination and the trinket n1, she passed the pot to Mike and the trinket to Liz.Reason for Liz is her distrust in politicians... Reason for Mike was \"looked engaged day 2\". And obviously the fact she had to pass it... Liz thinks due the potion that there is most likely no BL present, she thinks Hudsons Coven theory could be true. She thinks the Greg lynch was the right decision but mostly due their poor argument and claim, she is very sad that the reviver claim came so late and forced, thus denying them any chance of being revived. (there seems to be a discussion here between Janine and Greg?, <insert small potential NO U here>, while she was typing the summary I THINK Greg tuned in to say something about them being lit yadda yadda and Janine responds to that ). She's sceptical of Charles being another seer and then piling Jim of top of that. In her mind the number of seer-type roles it too high.  So in her mind Jim or Charles are lying. She also suspects Mike of being coven of some kind due to the role change. She makes a not here that Mike does not agree with this assumption but it seems Mike did not object during the summary as much as Greg. Altho there is some discussion going on after it, but nothing definitive enough for me to give a proper account on who she talked to and what exactly it was about.   Bill claims beholder that was blocked n1 and saw nothing n2 when beholding Ella night 2. Janine says she redacted some of the thoughts poor Bill had about being eaten N2 by liz for \"apparently no reason besides being blocked\", which upset them because they obviously can't do much about it. There's a note that I should make clear that this were no personal attacks but just their opinion about the play to eat them.  Bill is more on the wolves train and finds it possible that Liz is just straight up evil (I mean he's totally not biased). Janine asked bill for his items during the summary but when I'm writing this got no response yet, I'll check in the morning if there's more (see addendum). Bill also considers a wolf team with DW or pots likely as the mentioned day 2.  Mike claims to have rerolled into a curator with the following check:  Arkveni, Potion of Cleansing and Potion Weakness between:  Greg, Sherlock, Jim, Watson, Charles. He's sure that him and Bill are innocent and that no MW could be that bad at choosing target, so he thinks Liz is probably wolf or some other killing evil. They are also sus on Watson for trying to protect the prot which is a get out of jail free card. He made the suggestion that Janine died to warlock due to naive seer being non WC. On a total siden-ote... Mike thinks I'm full of shit, which obviously makes him wrong.

Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ImTownSRSLY","Message":"Janine confirms the dig by Ella, her visits were n1 DrWatson and N2 Molly, both came back Village for obvious reasons. Janine said she very much appreciates Hudson for their biscuits (she misses them) and thinks that Hudson is doing a good job. They initially had slight suspicion on Hudson being BMC but they claim they'd be glad to be fooled by it if true. There seem to be no indication of BMC from anyone so that's out of the picture. Next point in her list is that apparently she had a Minor potion of incrimination and the trinket n1, she passed the pot to Mike and the trinket to Liz.Reason for Liz is her distrust in politicians... Reason for Mike was \"looked engaged day 2\". And obviously the fact she had to pass it... Janine thinks due the potion that there is most likely no BL present, she thinks Hudsons Coven theory could be true. She thinks the Greg lynch was the right decision but mostly due their poor argument and claim, she is very sad that the reviver claim came so late and forced, thus denying them any chance of being revived. (there seems to be a discussion here between Janine and Greg?, <insert small potential NO U here>, while she was typing the summary I THINK Greg tuned in to say something about them being lit yadda yadda and Janine responds to that ). She's sceptical of Charles being another seer and then piling Jim of top of that. In her mind the number of seer-type roles it too high.  So in her mind Jim or Charles are lying. She also suspects Mike of being coven of some kind due to the role change. She makes a not here that Mike does not agree with this assumption but it seems Mike did not object during the summary as much as Greg. Altho there is some discussion going on after it, but nothing definitive enough for me to give a proper account on who she talked to and what exactly it was about.   Bill claims beholder that was blocked n1 and saw nothing n2 when beholding Ella night 2. Janine says she redacted some of the thoughts poor Bill had about being eaten N2 by liz for \"apparently no reason besides being blocked\", which upset them because they obviously can't do much about it. There's a note that I should make clear that this were no personal attacks but just their opinion about the play to eat them.  Bill is more on the wolves train and finds it possible that Liz is just straight up evil (I mean he's totally not biased). Janine asked bill for his items during the summary but when I'm writing this got no response yet, I'll check in the morning if there's more (see addendum). Bill also considers a wolf team with DW or pots likely as the mentioned day 2.  Mike claims to have rerolled into a curator with the following check:  Arkveni, Potion of Cleansing and Potion Weakness between:  Greg, Sherlock, Jim, Watson, Charles. He's sure that him and Bill are innocent and that no MW could be that bad at choosing target, so he thinks Liz is probably wolf or some other killing evil. They are also sus on Watson for trying to protect the prot which is a get out of jail free card. He made the suggestion that Janine died to warlock due to naive seer being non WC. On a total side-note... Mike thinks I'm full of shit, which obviously makes him wrong.   Mike also tried to fulfill hudsons request on the incrimnation pot and alignment card. Mike told Janine that there proof or disproof that the pot changes the alignment card, closest case is ext-412 Night4 when AbedNadir gets checked. But those are highest card count cards.","Recipients":["moody","ImTownSRSLY","Niji"],"Eavesdroppers":["Default-Eavesdropper"],"GameId":"lky-003","TimeStamp":"2024-06-20T07:32:20.9885813Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.GhostMessageEvent,

Janine said she very much appreciates Hudson for their biscuits (she misses them) and thinks that Hudson is doing a good job. They initially had slight suspicion on Hudson being BMC but they claim they'd be glad to be fooled by it if true. There seem to be no indication of BMC from anyone so that's out of the picture. Next point in her list is that apparently she had a Minor potion of incrimination and the trinket n1, she passed the pot to Mike and the trinket to Liz.Reason for Liz is her distrust in politicians... Reason for Mike was \"looked engaged day 2\". And obviously the fact she had to pass it... Janine thinks due the potion that there is most likely no BL present, she thinks Hudsons Coven theory could be true. She thinks the Greg lynch was the right decision but mostly due their poor argument and claim, she is very sad that the reviver claim came so late and forced, thus denying them any chance of being revived. (there seems to be a discussion here between Janine and Greg?, <insert small potential NO U here>, while she was typing the summary I THINK Greg tuned in to say something about them being lit yadda yadda and Janine responds to that ). She's sceptical of Charles being another seer and then piling Jim of top of that. In her mind the number of seer-type roles it too high.  So in her mind Jim or Charles are lying. She also suspects Mike of being coven of some kind due to the role change. She makes a not here that Mike does not agree with this assumption but it seems Mike did not object during the summary as much as Greg. Altho there is some discussion going on after it, but nothing definitive enough for me to give a proper account on who she talked to and what exactly it was about.

Reason was both as an explanation for how Bill failed to steal Mikes tarot cards before he was killed (since as we read the mechanics the steal should happen before the kill), and as an explanation for the weird failed revive/purged role of Molly. Mike would also like to point out that in the case of coven, Sherlocks checks N1 and N2 doesn‚Äôt clear Moriarty and Watson. They could have same cards mag/dove/mag and then the N2 check could have dove as a difference in alignment cards if Greg is lit. Mike trusts Mrs Hudson, Holmes, Ella, Smallwood, Charles, Molly and maybe Edwin and is sus of Moriarty, Watson and Lestrade. Janine is inclined to agree on trusting Hudson, Ella, Charles and Molly. I find it strange if you‚Äôre (Edwin) lit, that you didn‚Äôt use or come out with the cleansing pot. Given that there haven‚Äôt been any poisons it seems that that pot was intended to cleanse some drunkyness? I also have a tunnel going on Elizabeth being Furie, since her claimed kills match up with the NT nights. If she does claim a kill tomorrow though, that goes out the window but puts her in a conflict with Mikes diseased reroll claim. My trouble with that tunnel is I can‚Äôt account for the Hound card in Sherlocks tarot card check, outside of a lycanthropy aura. I‚Äôm personally not onboard with Mrs Hudsons theory of Mike as Witch. If it is indeed coven as evils, he was very active in the theorycrafting on that subject down here, and has given me pretty lit vibes for what that‚Äôs worth ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I am inclined to be onboard with the coven as evil theory though. Elizabeth is still my main sus. If we‚Äôre wrong, and it‚Äôs wolves, I agree that there‚Äôs too few kills if we take out two MW kills.

At the same time we wanted a different coven team than normally is used. Relpda came with the idea to use an MW and use them as covens pet with the Shaman. This gave the MW an interesting dilemma once they figured it out; either starve themselves or kill. We immediately loved it. Unfortunately the uh2p is apparently wrong: The MW is not affected by the Shaman. Which is a shame, because the coven came with a brilliant plan on N3 to use the harlot rune on the person they were gonna lure the wolf to. It didn‚Äôt work and the diseased was killed instead. Tbh, I thought it was over for coven after this: arcanist had a check on the MW, Shane had a check on the warlock. Coven already guessed that there was an MW. To make up for this, we decided to give coven the outcome of the harlot rune in case their plan had worked. We also gave Greg a crossbow (the Arcanist got an extra check due to this, the MW couldn‚Äôt be redirected the next night cause he ate a diseased), but Greg got lynched.

Claims first Wed 20:47Claims: (Apologies for the wall of text) Bill claims Thief who started with Altruistic trinket, Tofrar Rune, Potion of Transmutation and a Potion of cleansing. He sent the trinket to Elizabeth, the Torfrar rune to Mrs Hudson, the Transmutation pot to Mike and a Potion of Cleansing to you, SirEdwin. He was blocked N1 and tried to steal back the transmutation pot from Mike on N2, when he was killed. He also walked into a Bear Trap that night. Mike still claims diseased who used transmutation pot and rerolled into a‚Ä¶ diseased üòÇ. He also started with Tarot cards which somehow weren‚Äôt stolen by Bill N2, but were stolen by his killer N3. He used them on Charles N3 - Lab/Dove Greg still claims Prot. He protected Mrs Hudson N3 Janine is indeed a seer. I was also inebriated from the start, so not DrunkSeer. So I could indeed be Naive Seer. N1 I checked Charles as village which could align with me being Naive. N2 I was drunk. Wed 20:48Theories: (More wall of Text) We were already discussing coven redirect/purge when Mrs Hudson came up with that. Reason was both as an explanation for how Bill failed to steal Mikes tarot cards before he was killed (since as we read the mechanics the steal should happen before the kill), and as an explanation for the weird failed revive/purged role of Molly. Mike would also like to point out that in the case of coven, Sherlocks checks N1 and N2 doesn‚Äôt clear Moriarty and Watson. They could have same cards mag/dove/mag and then the N2 check could have dove as a difference in alignment cards if Greg is lit. Mike trusts Mrs Hudson, Holmes, Ella, Smallwood, Charles, Molly and maybe Edwin and is sus of Moriarty, Watson and Lestrade. Janine is inclined to agree on trusting Hudson, Ella, Charles and Molly. I find it strange if you‚Äôre (Edwin) lit, that you didn‚Äôt use or come out with the cleansing pot. Given that there haven‚Äôt been any poisons it seems that that pot was intended to cleanse some drunkyness? I also have a tunnel going on Elizabeth being Furie, since her claimed kills match up with the NT nights. If she does claim a kill tomorrow though, that goes out the window but puts her in a conflict with Mikes diseased reroll claim. My trouble with that tunnel is I can‚Äôt account for the Hound card in Sherlocks tarot card check, outside of a lycanthropy aura. I‚Äôm personally not onboard with Mrs Hudsons theory of Mike as Witch. If it is indeed coven as evils, he was very active in the theorycrafting on that subject down here, and has given me pretty lit vibes for what that‚Äôs worth ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I am inclined to be onboard with the coven as evil theory though. Elizabeth is still my main sus. If we‚Äôre wrong, and it‚Äôs wolves, I agree that there‚Äôs too few kills if we take out two MW kills. And if it is coven I still think she‚Äôs a Furie. Wed 20:49I think that‚Äôs it for now. I‚Äôll probably relay some thoughts from Mike later and/or any corrections/additions the others might have. I‚Äôll also be very cross if you‚Äôre not lit, and I had to type all this for nothing üòÇ Wed 20:51Feel free to chime in fellow deaddies Wed 20:53I apologise for the horrible formatting, btw‚Ä¶ Wed 20:54Should have broken that up into more sections","PlayerName":"Lucky","OriginalName":"Lucky","GameId":"lky-003","TimeStamp":"2024-06-21T09:50:15.7081255Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.PostGameMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","Message":"üòÇüòÇüòÇ","PlayerName":"PapaSmurf","OriginalName":"PapaSmurf","GameId":"lky-003","TimeStamp":"2024-06-21T09:50:38.6437352Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.PostGameMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","Message":"Thank you Lucky","PlayerName":"PapaSmurf","OriginalName":"PapaSmurf","GameId":"lky-003","TimeStamp":"2024-06-21T09:50:42.7708869Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.PostGameMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","Message":"And that was the first half.

If the MW is lit, it explains why the coven haven't killed yet too (also would mean they have no furie). If I am right about this I think the GD will meet his demise tonight because from what I could tell she was the only known Labourer role (there is the stalker too but she had the rune) Thu 00:21Succubus - Bill claims to have stolen from me N2 but nothing happened, also he stepped into a bear trap. I think they set up the bear trap N1 and seeing that he claimed being able to visit, they decided to redirect him wherever they set up the trap. I also think Molly indeed was redirected Thu 00:21Alchemist and Witch - I think the setup is made with symmetry in mind. We had a pot of transmutation and a reviver, they have an Alchemist and a Witch, and Molly really does seem to have been purged Thu 00:21Alternatively, with symmetry in mind, it could be possible they have a Furie rather than Warlock. They have a furie we have MW and a Prot if Greg is lit. We didn't lynch 2 days after all.
