Vaults have 3 layers:\n1. the top layer with two relatively weak items like potions\n2. the middle layer with two stronger items for protection or persistent strengths\n3. the bottom layer with the strongest, usually destructive item.\n\nYou can pick one item from the highest layer of the vault that has any items in it. Regardless of whether you pick an item, the vault will pass automatically to another player after the night you have the item. The dangerous item at the bottom will therefore only be available N5 at the earliest, if every previous owner has picked an item from the vault. Vaults cannot be stolen or destroyed, but they disappear when empty :)\n\n## The vaults' whereabouts\nN1 the following players claim to have had a Mystic Vault:\n- KillerClown;\n- Gandorb;\n- FirstKill;\n- NotYourBropher;\n- DutchDiddler.\n\nBecause of the vaults' auto-pass mechanic it should be possible to figure out where they are at any given point. *KillerClown* says that If a vault holder gets killed, the vault goes to the GY with them and then is passed back to the living the next night. I can't confirm that because I struggled with the wording at that point.\n\n## Strategies\nI think it's important to talk about different ways to handle the vaults. So far we've had two: \n- One strategy can be to not take any items from the vault so that the dangerous items at the bottom stay inaccessible. This is what *KillerClown* aimed to do.\n- Another strategy is to take an item from the vault every night so that the dangerous items can be tied to more or less certain players. This is what I (*FirstKill*) tried to do. *Gandorb* also took an item.\n\n## I love this new item!\nIt adds a whole new layer to the game. It is strategic, involves a lot of players given the number and the auto-passes, and gives hints about the setup.","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-02T11:51:43.875637Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.PlayerSummaryUpdated, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Smugs","Summary":"I am Vigilant with a Wolf Pelt.

Vaults have 3 layers:\n1. the top layer with two relatively weak items like potions\n2. the middle layer with two stronger items for protection or persistent strengths\n3. the bottom layer with the strongest, usually destructive item.\n\nYou can pick one item from the highest layer of the vault that has any items in it. Regardless of whether you pick an item, the vault will pass automatically to another player after the night you have the item. The dangerous item at the bottom will therefore only be available N5 at the earliest, if every previous owner has picked an item from the vault. Vaults cannot be stolen or destroyed, but they disappear when empty :)\n\n## The vaults' whereabouts\nN1 the following players claim to have had a Mystic Vault:\n- KillerClown;\n- Gandorb;\n- FirstKill;\n- NotYourBropher;\n- DutchDiddler\n- DjinnTonic. \n\nBecause of the vaults' auto-pass mechanic it should be possible to figure out where they are at any given point. *KillerClown* says that If a vault holder gets killed, the vault goes to the GY with them and then is passed back to the living the next night. I can't confirm that because I struggled with the wording at that point.\n\n## Strategies\nI think it's important to talk about different ways to handle the vaults. So far we've had two: \n- One strategy can be to not take any items from the vault so that the dangerous items at the bottom stay inaccessible. This is what *KillerClown* aimed to do.\n- Another strategy is to take an item from the vault every night so that the dangerous items can be tied to more or less certain players. This is what I (*FirstKill*) tried to do. *Gandorb* also took an item.\n- We should also consider that giving the exact  contents of the vaults will allow evils who have changed avatar to pretend they had the vaults when it was their turn. \n\n## I love this new item!\nIt adds a whole new layer to the game. It is strategic, involves a lot of players given the number and the auto-passes, and gives hints about the setup.","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-02T15:10:31.5678225Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Smugs","Message":"Oh, Seer specifically","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"394e5b89-197d-48ce-85b9-1faaa0670e89","PlayersIdentity":"Mark_Tame","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-02T15:11:08.756342Z","RequiredUpToDay":2},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Smugs","Message":"Okay, makes sense.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"fc74493f-ea5b-4613-b2d2-aaa379dbc12e","PlayersIdentity":"Mark_Tame","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-02T15:11:13.960093Z","RequiredUpToDay":2},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Smugs","Message":"I thought by \"whatever flavour\" you were including all intel, which isn't what your sentence implies, so I just can't read.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"9d13a436-4bd5-4b13-abfc-462ad93fda45","PlayersIdentity":"Mark_Tame","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-02T15:11:57.5297915Z","RequiredUpToDay":2},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Yes Mark.

Regardless of whether you pick an item, the vault will pass automatically to the next player in the list of living players after the night you have the item. The item at the bottom will therefore only be available N5 at the earliest, if every previous owner has picked an item from the vault. Vaults cannot be stolen or destroyed, but they disappear when empty.\n\n## The vaults' whereabouts\nN1 the following players claim to have had a Mystic Vault:\n- KillerClown;\n- Gandorb;\n- FirstKill;\n- NotYourBropher;\n- DutchDiddler\n- DjinnTonic;\n- DivinerOnStrike;\n- SinceUBeenGone;\n- ??WargTF?? (D3 09:28 but unclear);\n- ??BillBangedAss?? (D3 09:28 but unclear);\n- MasonBrother (D3 09:38).\n\nBecause of the auto-pass mechanic it should be possible to figure out where they are at any given point. *KillerClown* says that If a vault holder gets killed, the vault goes to the GY with them and then is passed back to the living the next night. I can't confirm that because I struggled with the wording at that point. *BillBangedAss* could help here by saying clearly if they started with a vault or got one N2.\n\n## Strategies\nI think it's important to talk about different ways to handle the vaults. So far we've had two: \n- One strategy can be to not take any items from the vault so that the dangerous items at the bottom stay inaccessible. This is what *KillerClown* aimed to do.\n- Another strategy is to take an item from the vault every night so that the dangerous items can be tied to more or less certain players.

This should have come from *BillBangedAss*, but Bill claims he only received his vault N2 (D3 09:28). He clarifies (timestamp??) he didn't start with one.\n\nMason has specified the contents of his two vaults in his summary:\nD3 10:28:05\t\tMasonBrother\tPlayer Summary Updated \nAura: Greedy\n\nN1: Mystic Vault: Dagger of Paranoia, Steal Potion, (Ankh of Resurrection), (Ethereal Armour), ((Iron Collar)) \n\nNothing Taken\n\nN2: Mystic Vault: 2x Potion of Protection, (Manacles), (Disruption Orb), ((Warg's Bracer))\n\nNothing Taken\n\n# Mystic Vaults\n\nVaults have 3 layers:\n1. the top layer with two relatively weak items like potions\n2. the middle layer with two stronger items for protection or persistent strengths\n3. the bottom layer with the strongest item.\n\nYou can pick one item from the highest layer of the vault that has any items in it. Regardless of whether you pick an item, the vault will pass automatically to the next player in the list of living players after the night you have the item. The item at the bottom will therefore only be available N5 at the earliest, if every previous owner has picked an item from the vault. Vaults cannot be stolen or destroyed, but they disappear when empty.\n\n## The vaults' whereabouts\nN1 the following players claim to have had a Mystic Vault:\n- KillerClown;\n- Gandorb;\n- FirstKill;\n- NotYourBropher;\n- DutchDiddler\n- DjinnTonic;\n- DivinerOnStrike;\n- SinceUBeenGone;\n- **WargTF** (according to BillBangedAss, D3 09:28);\n- **BillBangedAss** (according to MasonBrother D3 09:02);\n- MasonBrother (D3 09:38).\n\nBecause of the auto-pass mechanic it should be possible to figure out where they are at any given point. *KillerClown* says that If a vault holder gets killed, the vault goes to the GY with them and then is passed back to the living the next night. I can't confirm that because I struggled with the wording at that point. *BillBangedAss* could help here by saying clearly if they started with a vault or got one N2.\n\n## Strategies\nI think it's important to talk about different ways to handle the vaults. So far we've had two: \n- One strategy can be to not take any items from the vault so that the dangerous items at the bottom stay inaccessible. This is what *KillerClown* aimed to do.\n- Another strategy is to take an item from the vault every night so that the dangerous items can be tied to more or less certain players. This is what I (*FirstKill*) tried to do. *Gandorb* also took an item.\n- We should also consider that giving the exact  contents of the vaults will allow evils who have changed avatar to pretend they had the vaults when it was their turn. \n\n## I love this new item!\nIt adds a whole new layer to the game. It is strategic, involves a lot of players given the number and the auto-passes, and gives hints about the setup.","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T11:59:06.0819554Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent,

This should have come from *BillBangedAss*, but Bill claims he only received his vault N2 (D3 09:28). He clarifies (D3 11:38) he didn't start with one.\n\nMason has specified the contents of his two vaults in his summary on D3 10:28:05:\n\nN1: Mystic Vault:\n1. Dagger of Paranoia, Steal Potion\n2. (Ankh of Resurrection), (Ethereal Armour)\n3. ((Iron Collar))\n- Nothing Taken\n\nN2: Mystic Vault:\n1. 2x Potion of Protection\n2. (Manacles), (Disruption Orb)\n3. ((Warg's Bracer))\n- Nothing Taken\n\n# Mystic Vaults\n\nVaults have 3 layers:\n1. the top layer with two relatively weak items like potions\n2. the middle layer with two stronger items for protection or persistent strengths\n3. the bottom layer with the strongest item.\n\nYou can pick one item from the highest layer of the vault that has any items in it. Regardless of whether you pick an item, the vault will pass automatically to the next player in the list of living players after the night you have the item. The item at the bottom will therefore only be available N5 at the earliest, if every previous owner has picked an item from the vault. Vaults cannot be stolen or destroyed, but they disappear when empty.\n\n## The vaults' whereabouts\nN1 the following players claim to have had a Mystic Vault:\n- KillerClown;\n- Gandorb;\n- FirstKill;\n- NotYourBropher;\n- DutchDiddler\n- DjinnTonic;\n- DivinerOnStrike;\n- SinceUBeenGone;\n- **WargTF** (according to BillBangedAss, D3 09:28);\n- **BillBangedAss** (according to MasonBrother D3 09:02);\n- MasonBrother (D3 09:38).\n\nBecause of the auto-pass mechanic it should be possible to figure out where they are at any given point. *KillerClown* says that If a vault holder gets killed, the vault goes to the GY with them and then is passed back to the living the next night. I can't confirm that because I struggled with the wording at that point. *BillBangedAss* could help here by saying clearly if they started with a vault or got one N2.\n\n## Strategies\nI think it's important to talk about different ways to handle the vaults. So far we've had two: \n- One strategy can be to not take any items from the vault so that the dangerous items at the bottom stay inaccessible. This is what *KillerClown* aimed to do.\n- Another strategy is to take an item from the vault every night so that the dangerous items can be tied to more or less certain players. This is what I (*FirstKill*) tried to do. *Gandorb* also took an item.\n- We should also consider that giving the exact  contents of the vaults will allow evils who have changed avatar to pretend they had the vaults when it was their turn. \n\n## I love this new item!\nIt adds a whole new layer to the game. It is strategic, involves a lot of players given the number and the auto-passes, and gives hints about the setup.","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T12:11:13.6137624Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ShaneMcC","Message":"It's also possible that it did allow manual passing N1 and Modin fixed it afterwards as the changelog specificially claims it can't be passed and that came mid-day yesterday","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"a3942b80-452c-486c-bf1c-261e9a97b1d5","PlayersIdentity":"DutchDiddler","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T12:11:16.7079209Z","RequiredUpToDay":3},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ShaneMcC","Message":"I did not try passing any that I have seen","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"f29c7472-933b-40c2-bd42-495a5cabac6a","PlayersIdentity":"DutchDiddler","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T12:11:32.013657Z","RequiredUpToDay":3},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Smugs","Message":"Djinn's vault would have otherwise been with Bropher last night, so Djinn could easily have let that conflict run","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"f5192b04-d9eb-45ac-ad9d-90f38861350c","PlayersIdentity":"Mark_Tame","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T12:11:55.7934528Z","RequiredUpToDay":3},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Smugs","Message":"Anyone got any shit they can start?","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"d89f0c0b-213a-4169-abfe-4967370652ff","PlayersIdentity":"Mark_Tame","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T12:12:43.6092897Z","RequiredUpToDay":3},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Smugs","Message":"Bill, did you say your vault last night had an item removed?","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"a5f598de-fa15-4b68-ab36-fc5b2b09e9b6","PlayersIdentity":"Mark_Tame","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T12:13:23.2680256Z","RequiredUpToDay":3},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Smugs","Message":"So Warg removed one or nah?","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"02020bac-b980-434d-be34-e203bcb3a59d","PlayersIdentity":"Mark_Tame","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T12:13:33.0711748Z","RequiredUpToDay":3},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Guihmo","Message":"Yeah, and I removed another","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"d75f4099-2d1b-4f5b-a4c1-b83d8007e7f1","PlayersIdentity":"BillBangedAss","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T12:13:41.6533475Z","RequiredUpToDay":3},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"SavvySteve","Message":"Exciting","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"835558a9-6866-4623-87f9-5e83ef5a85b0","PlayersIdentity":"MasonBrother","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T12:14:12.2987163Z","RequiredUpToDay":3},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"SavvySteve","Message":"I get to briefly hold a level 2 items before I'm brutally knocked out","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"cf355a36-a6b6-4d2f-878b-adc684fc6a31","PlayersIdentity":"MasonBrother","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T12:14:30.1353764Z","RequiredUpToDay":3},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"I am a bit concerned that Bropher is the one who would normally have received Djinn's vault without the trinket-forced manuar pass thing.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"7ecb14d9-5459-4c6b-80bf-050823b91b7a","PlayersIdentity":"FirstKill","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T12:16:16.8008361Z","RequiredUpToDay":3},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"And he's not here to confirm or deny it.

I can't confirm that because I struggled with the wording at that point. \n\n## Unusual vault moves between Djinn and Mason\n*MasonBrother* claims to have started with a vault (D3 09:38) and to have received a vault N2 (D3 09:02). This should have come from *BillBangedAss*, but Bill claims he only received his vault N2 (D3 09:28). He clarifies (D3 11:38) he didn't start with one.\n\n*DjinnTonic* claims Mason's N2 vault came from them (D3 12:05); they tried to pass it manually and think this worked because of the trinket they started with. But if this theory is not true, the vault would have passed to *NotYourBropher*. They got killed N2, so can't confirm the theory.\n\nMason has specified the contents of his two vaults in his summary on D3 10:28:05:\n\nN1: Mystic Vault:\n1. Dagger of Paranoia, Steal Potion\n2. (Ankh of Resurrection), (Ethereal Armour)\n3. ((Iron Collar))\n- Nothing Taken\n\nN2: Mystic Vault:\n1. 2x Potion of Protection\n2. (Manacles), (Disruption Orb)\n3. ((Warg's Bracer))\n- Nothing Taken\n\n## Strategies\nI think it's important to talk about different ways to handle the vaults. So far we've had two: \n- One strategy can be to not take any items from the vault so that the dangerous items at the bottom stay inaccessible. This is what *KillerClown* aimed to do.\n- Another strategy is to take an item from the vault every night so that the dangerous items can be tied to more or less certain players. This is what I (*FirstKill*) tried to do. *Gandorb* also took an item.\n- We should also consider that giving the exact  contents of the vaults will allow evils who have changed avatar to pretend they had the vaults when it was their turn. \n\n## I love this new item!\nIt adds a whole new layer to the game. It is strategic, involves a lot of players given the number and the auto-passes, and gives hints about the setup.","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T18:43:18.0768328Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Mark_T","Message":"I imagine it was a mixture of evils and village","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"3b51ab31-e532-47c4-a7bb-995f33dfbceb","PlayersIdentity":"SinceUBeenGone","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T18:43:22.1269981Z","RequiredUpToDay":3},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Mark_T","Message":"At least one was with village anyway :p","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"88bcfa97-1d46-4df6-ad34-75f7b2ddb8f1","PlayersIdentity":"SinceUBeenGone","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T18:43:32.393349Z","RequiredUpToDay":3},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"PapaSmurf","Message":"i meant started with a gauntlet outside of the vaults SinceUBeenGone","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"c4fb3fbd-a883-46a8-b1d9-49945793624b","PlayersIdentity":"DefaultExecution","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-03T18:44:44.2163834Z","RequiredUpToDay":3},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"PapaSmurf","Message":"I’m also pretty curious about the vault that Bropher had, and what they picked over a Pelt (as has been mentioned).

I can't confirm that because I struggled with the wording at that point. \n\n## Unusual vault moves between Djinn and Mason\n*MasonBrother* claims to have started with a vault (D3 09:38) and to have received a vault N2 (D3 09:02). This should have come from *BillBangedAss*, but Bill claims he only received his vault N2 (D3 09:28). He clarifies (D3 11:38) he didn't start with one.\n\n*DjinnTonic* claims Mason's N2 vault came from them (D3 12:05); they tried to pass it manually and think this worked because of the trinket they started with. But if this theory is not true, the vault would have passed to *NotYourBropher*. They got killed N2, so can't confirm the theory.\n\nMason has specified the contents of his two vaults in his summary on D3 10:28:05:\n\nN1: Mystic Vault:\n1. Dagger of Paranoia, Steal Potion\n2. (Ankh of Resurrection), (Ethereal Armour)\n3. ((Iron Collar))\n- Nothing Taken\n\nN2: Mystic Vault:\n1. 2x Potion of Protection\n2. (Manacles), (Disruption Orb)\n3. ((Warg's Bracer))\n- Nothing Taken\n\n## Strategies\nI think it's important to talk about different ways to handle the vaults. So far we've had two: \n- One strategy can be to not take any items from the vault so that the dangerous items at the bottom stay inaccessible. This is what *KillerClown* aimed to do.\n- Another strategy is to take an item from the vault every night so that the dangerous items can be tied to more or less certain players. This is what I (*FirstKill*) tried to do. *Gandorb* also took an item.\n- We should also consider that giving the exact  contents of the vaults will allow evils who have changed avatar to pretend they had the vaults when it was their turn. \n\n## I love this new item!\nIt adds a whole new layer to the game. It is strategic, involves a lot of players given the number and the auto-passes, and gives hints about the setup.","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T12:39:32.2292395Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"PapaSmurf","Message":"And I’ll let FirstKill confirm the rune on parrot, but that sounds right to me","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"81894dce-0c75-471b-9cde-b116233a4814","PlayersIdentity":"DefaultExecution","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T12:39:38.026594Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationRetractedEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","Target":"Guihmo","PlayerName":"Smugs","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T12:40:11.7424967Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Smugs","Target":"ShaneMcC","TotalVotesForPlayer":5,"GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T12:40:11.7425053Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Smugs","Message":"I would rather we do something than wait around for Dutch.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"b6729fae-fa50-4ec2-b15d-d5f74ffac486","PlayersIdentity":"Mark_Tame","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T12:40:40.1266147Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Smugs","Message":"But I have nothing I can do on my own.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"26e1f130-060f-455a-a392-c21458c704f6","PlayersIdentity":"Mark_Tame","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T12:40:53.6777718Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Smugs","Message":"I think I'm just going to park First as a Villager","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"840d0314-33a2-434a-abce-13963b01a1d7","PlayersIdentity":"Mark_Tame","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T12:41:15.775333Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"That rune is right, thanks for confirming Parrot","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"6c348c96-851b-42e1-b50b-3904638b801a","PlayersIdentity":"FirstKill","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T12:41:18.1816595Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"I was getting nervous about you because:  ","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"73dc062a-850b-4799-a2fa-616bddf85386","PlayersIdentity":"FirstKill","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T12:41:47.851239Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"a) there was that mistake in your bottom tier item this morning","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"4fec9020-bab1-489a-b801-9c8c9f5ef95f","PlayersIdentity":"FirstKill","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T12:42:12.4925327Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"b) I don't remember the squawks reducing so quickly with previous parrots","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"1f33e26d-b4b8-4fe6-bfa1-732e6e691390","PlayersIdentity":"FirstKill","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T12:42:39.7084001Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"But I may be mistaken on that","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"9064596c-3a1f-4bc2-aeb4-63f86f7db457","PlayersIdentity":"FirstKill","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T12:42:49.0607Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"And yes, Mark, a shift was what I had in mind because of that.

I can't confirm that because I struggled with the wording at that point. \n\n## Unusual vault moves between Djinn and Mason\n*MasonBrother* claims to have started with a vault (D3 09:38) and to have received a vault N2 (D3 09:02). This should have come from *BillBangedAss*, but Bill claims he only received his vault N2 (D3 09:28).

But if this theory is not true, the vault would have passed to *NotYourBropher*. They got killed N2, so can't confirm the theory.\n\nMason has specified the contents of his two vaults in his summary on D3 10:28:05:\n\nN1: Mystic Vault:\n1. Dagger of Paranoia, Steal Potion\n2. (Ankh of Resurrection), (Ethereal Armour)\n3. ((Iron Collar))\n- Nothing Taken\n\nN2: Mystic Vault:\n1. 2x Potion of Protection\n2. (Manacles), (Disruption Orb)\n3. ((Warg's Bracer))\n- Nothing Taken\n\n## Strategies\nI think it's important to talk about different ways to handle the vaults. So far we've had two: \n- One strategy can be to not take any items from the vault so that the dangerous items at the bottom stay inaccessible. This is what *KillerClown* aimed to do.\n- Another strategy is to take an item from the vault every night so that the dangerous items can be tied to more or less certain players. This is what I (*FirstKill*) tried to do. *Gandorb* also took an item.\n- We should also consider that giving the exact  contents of the vaults will allow evils who have changed avatar to pretend they had the vaults when it was their turn. \n\n## I love this new item!\nIt adds a whole new layer to the game. It is strategic, involves a lot of players given the number and the auto-passes, and gives hints about the setup.","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T13:06:55.829389Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"snowbloom","Message":"DefinitelyVanilla is right, I didn’t take the pot from the vault ","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"30674eac-e442-4670-be2b-1d898d41b278","PlayersIdentity":"DoingADobby","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T13:09:03.1892859Z","RequiredUpToDay":4},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.PlayerSummaryUpdated, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"snowbloom","Summary":"- N1: roleblocked\n- N2: received a vault (Concitiorum), took nothing  \n- N3: received a vault (Heart of Hades)","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T13:09:45.3013397Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.PlayerSummaryUpdated, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Summary":"# The vaults' whereabouts\nN1 the following players claim to have had a Mystic Vault:\n- FirstKill (claimed D2); confirmed by Succubish and DefaultExecution\n- Gandorb (claimed D2); confirmed by DivinerOnStrike, Deadies (but not number of items)\n- DivinerOnStrike (claimed D3); confirmed by Deadies (4 items)\n- **WargTF**; claimed by BillBangedAss, D3 09:28);\n- MasonBrother (D3 09:38); confirmed by DjinnTonic\n- DjinnTonic (claimed D2); passed owing to trinket, confirmed by MasonBrother\n- NotYourBropher (claimed D2); died N2;  vault confirmed by CerealDestroyer;\n- SinceUBeenGone; confirmed D4 by *Parrot* (ex KillerClown) **but with a mistake in the bottom tier item that suggests Parrot got it from *DutchDiddler* who preceded his new position in the list**\n- KillerClown (claimed D2); N2 changed to Parrot and moved to last position in the list; ??confirmed by *DutchDiddler*?? and DoingADobby\n- DutchDiddler; confirmed by DoingADobby (4 items, D4 13:0x) and DefinitelyVanilla (4 items).\n\nBecause of the auto-pass mechanic it should be possible to figure out where they are at any given point. *KillerClown* says that If a vault holder gets killed, the vault goes to the GY with them and then is passed back to the living the next night.

But if this theory is not true, the vault would have passed to *NotYourBropher*. They got killed N2, so can't confirm the theory.\n\nMason has specified the contents of his two vaults in his summary on D3 10:28:05:\n\nN1: Mystic Vault:\n1. Dagger of Paranoia, Steal Potion\n2. (Ankh of Resurrection), (Ethereal Armour)\n3. ((Iron Collar))\n- Nothing Taken\n\nN2: Mystic Vault:\n1. 2x Potion of Protection\n2. (Manacles), (Disruption Orb)\n3. ((Warg's Bracer))\n- Nothing Taken\n\n## Strategies\nI think it's important to talk about different ways to handle the vaults. So far we've had two: \n- One strategy can be to not take any items from the vault so that the dangerous items at the bottom stay inaccessible. This is what *KillerClown* aimed to do.\n- Another strategy is to take an item from the vault every night so that the dangerous items can be tied to more or less certain players. This is what I (*FirstKill*) tried to do. *Gandorb* also took an item.\n- We should also consider that giving the exact  contents of the vaults will allow evils who have changed avatar to pretend they had the vaults when it was their turn. \n\n## I love this new item!\nIt adds a whole new layer to the game. It is strategic, involves a lot of players given the number and the auto-passes, and gives hints about the setup.","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T13:11:42.0812293Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Right, I'm really going now.

I can't confirm that because I struggled with the wording at that point. \n\n## Unusual vault moves between Djinn and Mason\n*MasonBrother* claims to have started with a vault (D3 09:38) and to have received a vault N2 (D3 09:02). This should have come from *BillBangedAss*, but Bill claims he only received his vault N2 (D3 09:28). He clarifies (D3 11:38) he didn't start with one.\n\n*DjinnTonic* claims Mason's N2 vault came from them (D3 12:05); they tried to pass it manually and think this worked because of the trinket they started with. But if this theory is not true, the vault would have passed to *NotYourBropher*. They got killed N2, so can't confirm the theory.\n\nMason has specified the contents of his two vaults in his summary on D3 10:28:05:\n\nN1: Mystic Vault:\n1. Dagger of Paranoia, Steal Potion\n2. (Ankh of Resurrection), (Ethereal Armour)\n3. ((Iron Collar))\n- Nothing Taken\n\nN2: Mystic Vault:\n1. 2x Potion of Protection\n2. (Manacles), (Disruption Orb)\n3. ((Warg's Bracer))\n- Nothing Taken\n\n## Strategies\nI think it's important to talk about different ways to handle the vaults. So far we've had two: \n- One strategy can be to not take any items from the vault so that the dangerous items at the bottom stay inaccessible. This is what *KillerClown* aimed to do.\n- Another strategy is to take an item from the vault every night so that the dangerous items can be tied to more or less certain players. This is what I (*FirstKill*) tried to do. *Gandorb* also took an item.\n- We should also consider that giving the exact  contents of the vaults will allow evils who have changed avatar to pretend they had the vaults when it was their turn. \n\n## I love this new item!\nIt adds a whole new layer to the game. It is strategic, involves a lot of players given the number and the auto-passes, and gives hints about the setup.","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T17:55:36.3048109Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent,

their WolfPelt\n\n### Clown (now Parrot): Villager\n\n\n# The vaults' whereabouts\nN1 the following players claim to have had a Mystic Vault:\n- FirstKill (claimed D2); confirmed by Succubish and DefaultExecution\n- Gandorb (claimed D2); confirmed by DivinerOnStrike, Deadies (but not number of items)\n- DivinerOnStrike (claimed D3); confirmed by Deadies (4 items)\n- **WargTF**; claimed by BillBangedAss, D3 09:28);\n- MasonBrother (D3 09:38); confirmed by DjinnTonic\n- DjinnTonic (claimed D2); passed owing to trinket, confirmed by MasonBrother\n- NotYourBropher (claimed D2); died N2;  vault confirmed by CerealDestroyer;\n- SinceUBeenGone; confirmed D4 by *Parrot* (ex KillerClown) **but with a mistake in the bottom tier item that suggests Parrot got it from *DutchDiddler* who preceded his new position in the list**\n- KillerClown (claimed D2); N2 changed to Parrot and moved to last position in the list; ??confirmed by *DutchDiddler*?? and DoingADobby\n- DutchDiddler; confirmed by DoingADobby (4 items, D4 13:0x) and DefinitelyVanilla (4 items).\n\nBecause of the auto-pass mechanic it should be possible to figure out where they are at any given point. *KillerClown* says that If a vault holder gets killed, the vault goes to the GY with them and then is passed back to the living the next night. I can't confirm that because I struggled with the wording at that point. \n\n## Unusual vault moves between Djinn and Mason\n*MasonBrother* claims to have started with a vault (D3 09:38) and to have received a vault N2 (D3 09:02). This should have come from *BillBangedAss*, but Bill claims he only received his vault N2 (D3 09:28). He clarifies (D3 11:38) he didn't start with one.\n\n*DjinnTonic* claims Mason's N2 vault came from them (D3 12:05); they tried to pass it manually and think this worked because of the trinket they started with. But if this theory is not true, the vault would have passed to *NotYourBropher*. They got killed N2, so can't confirm the theory.\n\nMason has specified the contents of his two vaults in his summary on D3 10:28:05:\n\nN1: Mystic Vault:\n1. Dagger of Paranoia, Steal Potion\n2. (Ankh of Resurrection), (Ethereal Armour)\n3. ((Iron Collar))\n- Nothing Taken\n\nN2: Mystic Vault:\n1. 2x Potion of Protection\n2. (Manacles), (Disruption Orb)\n3. ((Warg's Bracer))\n- Nothing Taken\n\n## Strategies\nI think it's important to talk about different ways to handle the vaults. So far we've had two: \n- One strategy can be to not take any items from the vault so that the dangerous items at the bottom stay inaccessible.

mechanic it should be possible to figure out where they are at any given point. *KillerClown* says that If a vault holder gets killed, the vault goes to the GY with them and then is passed back to the living the next night. I can't confirm that because I struggled with the wording at that point. \n\n## Unusual vault moves between Djinn and Mason\n*MasonBrother* claims to have started with a vault (D3 09:38) and to have received a vault N2 (D3 09:02). This should have come from *BillBangedAss*, but Bill claims he only received his vault N2 (D3 09:28). He clarifies (D3 11:38) he didn't start with one.\n\n*DjinnTonic* claims Mason's N2 vault came from them (D3 12:05); they tried to pass it manually and think this worked because of the trinket they started with. But if this theory is not true, the vault would have passed to *NotYourBropher*. They got killed N2, so can't confirm the theory.\n\nMason has specified the contents of his two vaults in his summary on D3 10:28:05:\n\nN1: Mystic Vault:\n1. Dagger of Paranoia, Steal Potion\n2. (Ankh of Resurrection), (Ethereal Armour)\n3. ((Iron Collar))\n- Nothing Taken\n\nN2: Mystic Vault:\n1. 2x Potion of Protection\n2. (Manacles), (Disruption Orb)\n3. ((Warg's Bracer))\n- Nothing Taken\n\n## Strategies\nI think it's important to talk about different ways to handle the vaults. So far we've had two: \n- One strategy can be to not take any items from the vault so that the dangerous items at the bottom stay inaccessible. This is what *KillerClown* aimed to do.\n- Another strategy is to take an item from the vault every night so that the dangerous items can be tied to more or less certain players. This is what I (*FirstKill*) tried to do. *Gandorb* also took an item.\n- We should also consider that giving the exact  contents of the vaults will allow evils who have changed avatar to pretend they had the vaults when it was their turn. \n\n## I love this new item!\nIt adds a whole new layer to the game. It is strategic, involves a lot of players given the number and the auto-passes, and gives hints about the setup.","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-04T19:40:28.8286392Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent,

confirmed by DivinerOnStrike, Deadies (but not number of items)\n- DivinerOnStrike (claimed D3); confirmed by Deadies (4 items)\n- **WargTF**; claimed by BillBangedAss, D3 09:28);\n- MasonBrother (D3 09:38); confirmed by DjinnTonic\n- DjinnTonic (claimed D2); passed owing to trinket, confirmed by MasonBrother\n- NotYourBropher (claimed D2); died N2;  vault confirmed by CerealDestroyer;\n- SinceUBeenGone; confirmed D4 by *Parrot* (ex KillerClown) **but with a mistake in the bottom tier item that suggests Parrot got it from *DutchDiddler* who preceded his new position in the list**\n- KillerClown (claimed D2); N2 changed to Parrot and moved to last position in the list; ??confirmed by *DutchDiddler*?? and DoingADobby\n- DutchDiddler; confirmed by DoingADobby (4 items, D4 13:0x) and DefinitelyVanilla (4 items).\n\nBecause of the auto-pass mechanic it should be possible to figure out where they are at any given point. *KillerClown* says that If a vault holder gets killed, the vault goes to the GY with them and then is passed back to the living the next night. I can't confirm that because I struggled with the wording at that point. \n\n## Unusual vault moves between Djinn and Mason\n*MasonBrother* claims to have started with a vault (D3 09:38) and to have received a vault N2 (D3 09:02). This should have come from *BillBangedAss*, but Bill claims he only received his vault N2 (D3 09:28). He clarifies (D3 11:38) he didn't start with one.\n\n*DjinnTonic* claims Mason's N2 vault came from them (D3 12:05); they tried to pass it manually and think this worked because of the trinket they started with. But if this theory is not true, the vault would have passed to *NotYourBropher*. They got killed N2, so can't confirm the theory.\n\nMason has specified the contents of his two vaults in his summary on D3 10:28:05:\n\nN1: Mystic Vault:\n1. Dagger of Paranoia, Steal Potion\n2. (Ankh of Resurrection), (Ethereal Armour)\n3. ((Iron Collar))\n- Nothing Taken\n\nN2: Mystic Vault:\n1. 2x Potion of Protection\n2. (Manacles), (Disruption Orb)\n3. ((Warg's Bracer))\n- Nothing Taken\n\n## Strategies\nI think it's important to talk about different ways to handle the vaults. So far we've had two: \n- One strategy can be to not take any items from the vault so that the dangerous items at the bottom stay inaccessible. This is what *KillerClown* aimed to do.\n- Another strategy is to take an item from the vault every night so that the dangerous items can be tied to more or less certain players. This is what I (*FirstKill*) tried to do. *Gandorb* also took an item.\n- We should also consider that giving the exact  contents of the vaults will allow evils who have changed avatar to pretend they had the vaults when it was their turn. \n\n## I love this new item!\nIt adds a whole new layer to the game. It is strategic, involves a lot of players given the number and the auto-passes, and gives hints about the setup.","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:03:59.3715017Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent,

It is strategic, involves a lot of players given the number and the auto-passes, and gives hints about the setup.","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:19:55.9077498Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"snowbloom","Message":"And yes, I did not take anything from the Heart vault","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"4fec7dab-0d68-410c-b822-5a24735aab44","PlayersIdentity":"DoingADobby","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:20:19.6591315Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"What items were left in the vault Vanilla?","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"fc9b4226-16c9-43d7-b0ad-6d4c0264324d","PlayersIdentity":"FirstKill","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:20:51.2018022Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"snowbloom","Message":"My stall last night was DefVanilla, they went to DefaultExecution","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"a4651a36-d5be-47a2-94ad-ac9f29efbf65","PlayersIdentity":"DoingADobby","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:21:06.0775433Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"snowbloom","Message":"*stalk","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"a26ce44f-5996-4235-83cc-f0d0d39abaa0","PlayersIdentity":"DoingADobby","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:21:10.5497373Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Merlin_Brum","Message":"WELL WELL WELL!!!","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"cadb0844-e140-42cd-978a-e387a23cf636","PlayersIdentity":"BreakfastMargaritaCat","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:21:23.7265283Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"snowbloom","Message":"So they’re a Sleepwalker if vanilla ","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"f33caba4-12f9-4231-9bb3-ab6f4e832dc9","PlayersIdentity":"DoingADobby","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:21:27.462418Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"snowbloom","Message":"Or just evil ","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"ac97aa4d-e53d-40ca-bd2e-9e3582d78849","PlayersIdentity":"DoingADobby","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:21:31.0299413Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationRetractedEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","Target":"Relpda","PlayerName":"marcweide","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:21:31.7604491Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Target":"Bird","TotalVotesForPlayer":1,"GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:21:31.7604566Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationRetractedEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","Target":"Relpda","PlayerName":"Merlin_Brum","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:21:37.9076534Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Merlin_Brum","Target":"Bird","TotalVotesForPlayer":2,"GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:21:37.9076565Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Glad to be FIRST!","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"ee9738a6-6fe1-4be6-b5aa-4788a47bcab6","PlayersIdentity":"FirstKill","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:21:47.7255691Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Merlin_Brum","Message":"I was waiting for it","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"45c89f77-de15-4022-9007-0356ea932d5a","PlayersIdentity":"BreakfastMargaritaCat","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:21:55.2472638Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Thanks Cat","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"a50e36db-0440-4b4b-9121-e808888ffc8b","PlayersIdentity":"FirstKill","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:22:04.461534Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Merlin_Brum","Message":"Wanted to switch instant, thought: NO!

I can't confirm that because I struggled with the wording at that point. \n\n## Unusual vault moves between Djinn and Mason\n*MasonBrother* claims to have started with a vault (D3 09:38) and to have received a vault N2 (D3 09:02). This should have come from *BillBangedAss*, but Bill claims he only received his vault N2 (D3 09:28). He clarifies (D3 11:38) he didn't start with one.\n\n*DjinnTonic* claims Mason's N2 vault came from them (D3 12:05); they tried to pass it manually and think this worked because of the trinket they started with. But if this theory is not true, the vault would have passed to *NotYourBropher*. They got killed N2, so can't confirm the theory.\n\nMason has specified the contents of his two vaults in his summary on D3 10:28:05:\n\nN1: Mystic Vault:\n1. Dagger of Paranoia, Steal Potion\n2. (Ankh of Resurrection), (Ethereal Armour)\n3. ((Iron Collar))\n- Nothing Taken\n\nN2: Mystic Vault:\n1. 2x Potion of Protection\n2. (Manacles), (Disruption Orb)\n3. ((Warg's Bracer))\n- Nothing Taken\n\n## Strategies\nI think it's important to talk about different ways to handle the vaults. So far we've had two: \n- One strategy can be to not take any items from the vault so that the dangerous items at the bottom stay inaccessible. This is what *KillerClown* aimed to do.\n- Another strategy is to take an item from the vault every night so that the dangerous items can be tied to more or less certain players. This is what I (*FirstKill*) tried to do. *Gandorb* also took an item.\n- We should also consider that giving the exact  contents of the vaults will allow evils who have changed avatar to pretend they had the vaults when it was their turn. \n\n## I love this new item!\nIt adds a whole new layer to the game. It is strategic, involves a lot of players given the number and the auto-passes, and gives hints about the setup.","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T13:26:12.7713524Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent,

This can be verified by Gandorb listening in on the GY.","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T14:03:02.9581713Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent,

Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Summary":"## Suspicious claims in my opinion\n\n### DefinitelyVanilla: vanilla (D5 13:14)\n- N4 was seen visiting DefaultExecution (killed) by Dobby (drunk stalker claim). \n\n### DutchDiddler: thief\nSuspected to be a wolf or Blood Moon Cultist) \n- N1 and N2: no thievery claimed after being asked specifically\n- N1: was seen visiting Deadies by Succubish (Drunk Harlot claim)\n- N1: claimed to use a Sjón rune on Deadies that he hasn't passed since (D4 19:50)\n- N3: robbed MasonBrother of a trinket\n- N4: claimed **not to have Bropher's Vault** with the Hammer of Destruction and suggests this may have been with Parrot because Parrot used to be KillerClown, one position before Dutch.\n\nReasons for suspicion:\n- presence of another thief claim, who claims clumsy aura and no starting items whereas DutchDiddler claims no aura and a rune N1\n- lack of thefts N1 and N2;\n- visit to Deadies N1 but not for thieving;\n- conflicts with Parrot over the Vault that started with NotYourBropher. \n\n### DivinerOnStrike: Inebriated Seer (D4 17:5x)\n- N1 Deadies: village (D4 18:17)\n- N2 DjinnTonic: village\n- N3 Succubish: drunk\n- N4: DutchDiddler: village (D5 09:15)\n\nReasons for suspicion:\n- missed cleansing message from Dobby's potion N4 - later confirmed\n- classic BH / BS fake claim\n- no wolf checks;\n- no checks on DefinitelyVanilla (under the radar) or BreakfastMargaritaCat (guaranteed wolf check so also a sanity check)\n\n### SinceUBeenGone: Courtesan (D4 20:22)\n- N1: Dobby\n- N2: Clown\n- N3: Mark_Tame\n- N4: MasonBrother (D5 11:57); also threw a block potion at DutchDiddler (confirmed)\n\nReasons for suspicion:\n- classic DW fake claim\n- questionable block targets (none on DefinitelyVanilla for instance)\n- took a poison potion from a vault and was left alone\n\n### Deadies: Pollygrapher\nReasons for suspicion:\n- checks are impossible to confirm so far.\n- no firm stance on Bill or Dutch (top susses)\n\n### MasonBrother: Diseased (D5 10:21)\nItems: DC, trinket\n- N3: trinket stolen by DutchDiddler (thief claim)\n- N4: blocked by SinceUBeenGone (10:22)\n- N4: took an item from the Thieves' Cowl vault (starting with Diviner)\n\nReasons for suspicion:\n- late claim, but understandable given the role\n- little activity that would make him an interesting wolf target\n\n### Bill: Militia (lynched D4)\n(following a Hound / Dove check from Gandorb)\n\n## Missing vaults\nDutchDiddler D5 17:20:\n\"I think Bropher's vault should have gone Bropher => Cereal => Since => Me\"\n\nFirstKillSun 17:25\n\"And you deny having had it, and so does Parrot who used to be Clown, one position before you.\"\n\nNote that DutchDiddler had the Altruistic Trinket he stole from MasonBrother, so **if he is lying about the vault he may have passed it anywhere**.\n\nN4, CerealDestroyer was expecting  to have the Vault that started with WargTF. He claimed not to have it. It was last claimed to be seen by MasonBrother. It could have gone to DjinnTonic but Cereal questioned this as Djinn was already dead.\n\n## Trinket-forced vault moves\nDjinnTonic claimed to move his N1 vault upwards, to Mason, who claimed D3 to have received it N2. \n\nMason has specified the contents of his two vaults in his summary on D3 10:28:05:\n\nN1: Mystic Vault:\n1. Dagger of Paranoia, Steal Potion\n2. (Ankh of Resurrection), (Ethereal Armour)\n3. ((Iron Collar))\n- Nothing Taken\n\nN2: Mystic Vault:\n1. 2x Potion of Protection\n2. (Manacles), (Disruption Orb)\n3. ((Warg's Bracer))\n- Nothing Taken\n\nGandorb claimed D5 to have used the trinket he received from Diviner to move his N4 vault upwards to DefaultExecution, who was killed that night. We should expect the vault and the trinket to be in the GY. This can be verified by Gandorb listening in on the GY.\n\n## The vaults' whereabouts\nN1 the following players claim to have had a Mystic Vault:\n- FirstKill (claimed D2); confirmed by Succubish and DefaultExecution\n- Gandorb (claimed D2); confirmed by DivinerOnStrike, Deadies (Fjät rune, war spear, heavy shield, war hammer; D5 13:41)\n- DivinerOnStrike (claimed D3); confirmed by Deadies (potion of tenacity, sjon rune, bear trap, thief’s cowl; D5 13:40)\n- **WargTF**; claimed by BillBangedAss (D3 09:28); confirmed by Bill and Mason (D4), claimed missing by CerealDestroyer (D5)\n- MasonBrother (D3 09:38); confirmed by DjinnTonic\n- DjinnTonic (claimed D2); passed owing to trinket, confirmed by MasonBrother\n- NotYourBropher (claimed D2); died N2;  vault confirmed by CerealDestroyer;\n- SinceUBeenGone; confirmed D4 by *Parrot* (ex KillerClown) **but with a mistake in the bottom tier item that suggests Parrot got it from *DutchDiddler* who preceded his new position in the list**\n- KillerClown (claimed D2); N2 changed to Parrot and moved to last position in the list; ??confirmed by *DutchDiddler*?? and DoingADobby\n- DutchDiddler; confirmed by DoingADobby (4 items, D4 13:0x) and DefinitelyVanilla (4 items).\n\n## Other claims\n**Mark_Tame: Crypt Thief**\n- N2: robbed WargTF\n- N3: got a Hvisla rune that was confirmed D4 on a countdown with Gandorb (Psychic claim) who had GY information from Warg.\n\n**FirstKill: Pagan**\n- N1: started with the Gauntlet of Blight vault; picked Välta rune\n- N2: received Välta rune from the vault and Altruistic Trinket from DjinnTonic (announced D2); passed the trinket to Diviner and the rune to KillerClown (now Parrot)\n- N4: had strange dreams (confirmed by Parrot)\n\n**Succubish: Drunk Harlot**\n- N1: Deadies visited by DutchDiddler and DivinerOnStrike (both confirmed)\n- N2: drunk\n- N3: FirstKill visited by noone\n- N4: drunk\n**DefaultExecution: GD** (killed N4)\n- N2 Warg: Villager (D4 19:09)\n- N3 NotYourBropher: Lycan\nConfirmed by Gandorb (Psychic claim listening in on Warg) on a countdown.\n\n**Gandorb: Psychic**\n\nClaimed corresponding information on D4 on separate countdowns with Mark_Tame (crypt thief claim) and DefaultExecution (GD claim).\n\n**Cereal: Curator**\n(details in summary)\n\n**DoingADobby: Drunk Stalker** (D4 16:38)\n- N1: drunk and blocked (tried OnStrike)\n- N2: drunk (OnStrike)\n- N3: Bill went nowhere\n- N4: DefinitelyVanilla went to DefaultExecution (killed in the night; D5 13:21 after Vanilla's claim)\n\n**BreakfastMargaritaCat: clumsy thief**\n- N1: robbed Diviner of nothing\n- N2: robbed Bropher of a Fjat rune and *undisclosed*\n- N3: robbed Cereal of their WolfPelt; passed an item to ??Gandorb??\n- N4: passed the Wolfpelt to *undisclosed*\n\n**Clown (now Parrot): Villager**","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T19:55:08.3398822Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent,

also threw a block potion at DutchDiddler (confirmed)\n\nReasons for suspicion:\n- classic DW fake claim\n- questionable block targets (N2 on KillerClown, none on DefinitelyVanilla for instance)\n- took a poison potion from a vault and was left alone\n\n### Deadies: Pollygrapher\nReasons for suspicion:\n- checks are impossible to confirm so far.\n- no firm stance on Bill or Dutch (top susses)\n\n### MasonBrother: Diseased (D5 10:21)\nItems: DC, trinket\n- N3: trinket stolen by DutchDiddler (thief claim)\n- N4: blocked by SinceUBeenGone (10:22)\n- N4: took an item from the Thieves' Cowl vault (starting with Diviner)\n\nReasons for suspicion:\n- late claim, but understandable given the role\n- little activity that would make him an interesting wolf target\n\n### Bill: Militia (lynched D4)\n(following a Hound / Dove check from Gandorb)\n\n## Missing vaults\nDutchDiddler D5 17:20:\n\"I think Bropher's vault should have gone Bropher => Cereal => Since => Me\"\n\nFirstKillSun 17:25\n\"And you deny having had it, and so does Parrot who used to be Clown, one position before you.\"\n\nNote that DutchDiddler had the Altruistic Trinket he stole from MasonBrother, so **if he is lying about the vault he may have passed it anywhere**.\n\nN4, CerealDestroyer was expecting  to have the Vault that started with WargTF. He claimed not to have it. It was last claimed to be seen by MasonBrother. It could have gone to DjinnTonic but Cereal questioned this as Djinn was already dead.\n\n## Trinket-forced vault moves\nDjinnTonic claimed to move his N1 vault upwards, to Mason, who claimed D3 to have received it N2. \n\nMason has specified the contents of his two vaults in his summary on D3 10:28:05:\n\nN1: Mystic Vault:\n1. Dagger of Paranoia, Steal Potion\n2. (Ankh of Resurrection), (Ethereal Armour)\n3. ((Iron Collar))\n- Nothing Taken\n\nN2: Mystic Vault:\n1. 2x Potion of Protection\n2. (Manacles), (Disruption Orb)\n3. ((Warg's Bracer))\n- Nothing Taken\n\nGandorb claimed D5 to have used the trinket he received from Diviner to move his N4 vault upwards to DefaultExecution, who was killed that night. We should expect the vault and the trinket to be in the GY. This can be verified by Gandorb listening in on the GY.\n\n## The vaults' whereabouts\nN1 the following players claim to have had a Mystic Vault:\n- FirstKill (claimed D2); confirmed by Succubish and DefaultExecution\n- Gandorb (claimed D2); confirmed by DivinerOnStrike, Deadies (Fjät rune, war spear, heavy shield, war hammer; D5 13:41)\n- DivinerOnStrike (claimed D3); confirmed by Deadies (potion of tenacity, sjon rune, bear trap, thief’s cowl; D5 13:40)\n- **WargTF**; claimed by BillBangedAss (D3 09:28); confirmed by Bill and Mason (D4), claimed missing by CerealDestroyer (D5)\n- MasonBrother (D3 09:38); confirmed by DjinnTonic\n- DjinnTonic (claimed D2); passed owing to trinket, confirmed by MasonBrother\n- NotYourBropher (claimed D2); died N2;  vault confirmed by CerealDestroyer;\n- SinceUBeenGone; confirmed D4 by *Parrot* (ex KillerClown) **but with a mistake in the bottom tier item that suggests Parrot got it from *DutchDiddler* who preceded his new position in the list**\n- KillerClown (claimed D2); N2 changed to Parrot and moved to last position in the list; ??confirmed by *DutchDiddler*?? and DoingADobby\n- DutchDiddler; confirmed by DoingADobby (4 items, D4 13:0x) and DefinitelyVanilla (4 items).\n\n## Other claims\n**Mark_Tame: Crypt Thief**\n- N2: robbed WargTF\n- N3: got a Hvisla rune that was confirmed D4 on a countdown with Gandorb (Psychic claim) who had GY information from Warg.\n\n**FirstKill: Pagan**\n- N1: started with the Gauntlet of Blight vault; picked Välta rune\n- N2: received Välta rune from the vault and Altruistic Trinket from DjinnTonic (announced D2); passed the trinket to Diviner and the rune to KillerClown (now Parrot)\n- N4: had strange dreams (confirmed by Parrot)\n\n**Succubish: Drunk Harlot**\n- N1: Deadies visited by DutchDiddler and DivinerOnStrike (both confirmed)\n- N2: drunk\n- N3: FirstKill visited by noone\n- N4: drunk\n**DefaultExecution: GD** (killed N4)\n- N2 Warg: Villager (D4 19:09)\n- N3 NotYourBropher: Lycan\nConfirmed by Gandorb (Psychic claim listening in on Warg) on a countdown.\n\n**Gandorb: Psychic**\n\nClaimed corresponding information on D4 on separate countdowns with Mark_Tame (crypt thief claim) and DefaultExecution (GD claim).\n\n**Cereal: Curator**\n- N1: checked a DC which could have been on five people including MasonBrother, who confirmed having it on D4 after his items had been stolen by DutchDiddler.\n- N4: checked a DC which could have been on five people including SinceUBeenGone but not including DutchDiddler who everybody expected to have it. SinceUBeenGone confirmed having taken another DC from a vault.\n\n**DoingADobby: Drunk Stalker** (D4 16:38)\n- N1: drunk and blocked (tried OnStrike)\n- N2: drunk (OnStrike)\n- N3: Bill went nowhere\n- N4: DefinitelyVanilla went to DefaultExecution (killed in the night; D5 13:21 after Vanilla's claim)\n\n**BreakfastMargaritaCat: clumsy thief**\n- N1: robbed Diviner of nothing\n- N2: robbed Bropher of a Fjat rune and *undisclosed*\n- N3: robbed Cereal of their WolfPelt; passed an item to ??Gandorb??\n- N4: passed the Wolfpelt to *undisclosed*\n\n**Clown (now Parrot): Villager**\n- N2 used a pollyjuice potion on themselves","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T20:22:34.3648598Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ImTownSRSLY","Message":"mh?","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"bd487952-4084-4db7-9cd0-1e4426efba38","PlayersIdentity":"Succubish","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T20:23:47.7578436Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ImTownSRSLY","Message":"@FirstKill","MentionedIdentities":["FirstKill"],"MentionedPlayers":["marcweide"],"MessageId":"6bd5cb21-938d-4a8e-96f9-d2b0d3e2a46e","PlayersIdentity":"Succubish","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T20:24:34.9984612Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Yes?","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"e7d2e9de-71c8-4733-a906-6f5f3314ba7f","PlayersIdentity":"FirstKill","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T20:25:11.0544147Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Just a suggestion about BMC given there's a vault missing which she's meant to receive tonight.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"4d0e717f-e434-475b-af6d-2379626a9c14","PlayersIdentity":"FirstKill","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T20:25:45.9363739Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Merlin_Brum","Message":"If its supposed to be at diddler, how will I get it tonight?","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"beecfa4b-c049-4614-888c-e16554ef9f4a","PlayersIdentity":"BreakfastMargaritaCat","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T20:26:32.1492735Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Merlin_Brum","Message":"I expect a trinket and the heart vault","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"e88aac15-916c-4afb-9a80-1c8fbd31f0de","PlayersIdentity":"BreakfastMargaritaCat","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T20:26:45.4861094Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Oh shucks, Dobby!","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"12e9c19d-44cf-4555-9af0-320f974965a9","PlayersIdentity":"FirstKill","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T20:27:15.1020408Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"I meant Dobby, Bish","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"4b0de102-bfdf-4058-b4f2-74f0de2ffce7","PlayersIdentity":"FirstKill","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T20:27:34.208838Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"marcweide","Message":"Oh by the way, I plan to move my vote for the selfish reason that IF Vanilla turns out to be Vanilla, I get a +1 vote for the rest of the game","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"9d1810e1-5d98-4086-beb3-2612d3294d3a","PlayersIdentity":"FirstKill","GameId":"dov-033","TimeStamp":"2025-01-05T20:28:04.6883021Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Merlin_Brum","Message":"I am waaaaay cuter than Dobby!
