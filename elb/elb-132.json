The same night, Dilophasauras was killed and possibly robbed of any item they may have had. (They hinted they were a vanilla when joking the whole elder threat might be a baseless scare). A wolf who got an item N4 won’t know if it came from me or Dilo, as they don’t know what it is. I want everyone to say whether they got an item last night that could possibly be from me, and then I’ll confirm what I did and what it might imply. \n- Dr Wu: not received an item\n- Mr Hammond: not received an item\n- Lex: received a tenacity pot. \n- Dr Grant: not received an item\n- TRex: not received an item\n\nI confirm I passed the potion to Lex based on her comments D2/3 which I found generally sensible and village-y. \n\nMr Hammond: cleared by TRex (N3: Tofrar rune: WC negative, role block corroborating orb possession)\n\nClaims to have been Drunk Seer:\n- N1 blocked by orb\n- N2 Drunk\n\nTRex: confirmed to be in possession of Tofrar rune by DrGrant (claimed D3 he used it N1 on MrDNA, claimed D4 he passed it to TRex)\n\nClaims to have been protector with following visits:\n- N1 DrGrant (random)\n- N2 Mr Hammond (presumably because he had passed the orb to an unknown target)\n\nDr Grant: confirmed to have given the correct positive WC check on MrDNA.\n\nClaims to have started as a villager with 1 (?) item.\n\nMrDNA: confirmed Elder following D3 lynch\n\nStrange coincidences:\n- Hammond passing the orb to the Elder of all people, who then claims it as if that is the reason no kill happened the night he had it. \n- TRex randomly protecting DrGrant and randomly being passed a rune by DrGrant the next night.\n\nFurther claims:\n- Lex: Mason Sergeant, no recruits N1 and N2, claims meaning to recruit Mr Hammond N3 (after the Elder lynch)\n- Tim: Villager, no items\n- Dr Wu: militia\n- Ray Arnold: Villager, one item, passed N3","GameId":"elb-132","TimeStamp":"2022-08-03T19:33:18.7597352Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Giovanniboyy","Message":"I think that's correct","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"4ce16cda-14ff-440c-84dc-c7fb3aa68991","GameId":"elb-132","TimeStamp":"2022-08-03T19:33:26.4219042Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Giovanniboyy","Message":"(Between the 3 of us anyway)","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"f86ba11a-ebff-4b52-88bb-f1606c01e2e9","GameId":"elb-132","TimeStamp":"2022-08-03T19:33:38.566835Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Giovanniboyy","Message":"Since Orb stuff and the Pot","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"b21635a2-ee85-4afc-9d25-9c7e33bbf344","GameId":"elb-132","TimeStamp":"2022-08-03T19:34:08.4075311Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Nine","Message":"I mean, in the end, it's clear that getting lit points was important in this game, so if the wolf was either given, or created by himself, the chances to get lit points, it was a good choice","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"214bf76e-84d7-4ac4-9881-17ae3dbdf9d9","GameId":"elb-132","TimeStamp":"2022-08-03T19:34:42.258003Z","RequiredUpToDay":5},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ShaunOfTheDev","Message":"'Orb stuff and the Pot' is a marvellous band name.

IF they use the crossbow then the village are alerted to this fact and that they have lost enduring (so that people dont just assume the game is lost). The alternative for the wolf was do nothing and carry on from that point, in which case no message is given. The wolf chose option 2 and opted not to use the crossbow to reclaim their missing kill, which SHOULD have meant no message was given. However, Modin is a powerful God but only when he has coffee. He had not had his coffee yet and so he mistakenly sent the message even though the wolf had chosen option 2, still has enduring and didn't use the crossbow.
