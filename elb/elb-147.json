The Chinese have described their head shapes as \"owl head\" and \"lion head\", and their mouth as \"frog mouths\" and their lips as \"earthworm lips\". They have a soft and long double coat that will tangle and mat easily if not brushed at least every 2 or 3 days. A Shih Tzu should stand no more than 26.7 cm (101⁄2\") at the withers and with an ideal weight of 4.0 to 7.5kg (9 to 17 lbs). Their floppy ears are covered with long hair, and their heavily hair-covered tail is carried curled over the back. The coat may be of any color, though white and with blazes of grey are frequently seen. A very noticeable feature is the underbite, which is required in the breed standard.","GameId":"elb-147","TimeStamp":"2025-07-25T18:31:49.2097323Z","RequiredUpToDay":999},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.PlayerSummaryUpdated, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"TheZeppo95","Summary":"Forming pack of doggos.
