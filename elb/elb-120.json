You outed Jack. Jack didnt stop playing. Kt still tried. And didnt make comments like you did. So if we are going to compare i can also talk about the vamp, the wolves, warlock becoming acolayte.. no one of them just stopped trying. You did. Thats where the difference is. This win is a team win its not 80 or 90 or 100 percent yours. Its 100 percent team victory. If you want to say its mostly yours, thats really false. Its our mistake you were even in that position and its 100 percent doves fault per say that you even stayed alive and everyone else got lynched. At the start we made a mistake for not lynching you for outing everyone and i will correct that in future games if anyone tries to pull off the same thing you did. Now, lets try and move past this game and play others and try and enjoy them. Next time please dont use the words like toxic, bitter and stuff. No need for that. At the end of the day this is a game. Where mostly you win by team effort not individually. So you need a team of people to win with.

In my personal circumstance, I felt that spinning the yarn of being coven, even though I was also outed as evil, had some legs in the game.  Glad I did it, as it meant Dougal got the Valta back!
