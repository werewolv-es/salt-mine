Jessica - Jessica has done some things that I don’t understand: Not voting Ham when they claimed the clarity pot and the crossbow. In the middle of that discussion they came on to vote EvilMorty. I sussed them as OG vamp, but that can’t be true anymore. Also cannot be Harpy (unless tenacious). Poopy: The last hour of yesterday really felt like we were being fooled by two evils, Fart and Ham. Fart has been weird consistently over the past days. Do I think Poopy should have blocked Ham? Yes. I tend to believe him, because I really believe Fart was evil. Beth - Harpy who started with a pelt? But then why send it to me. Not that sus to me. Or it’s the play of the year. Summer: She’s at the bottom of my sus list, but I don’t really know why. Could be a great fam recruit. EvilMorty - Checked as Wolf N2, been consistently sus (vamp with DC), would be a very dumb recruit. Unity - Can’t be evil, as much as I want her to be. Me - Doh.","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"ed8d3cf4-895a-4ab3-a7ea-dcb33a4c2d5e","PlayersIdentity":"Rick","GameId":"elb-148","TimeStamp":"2025-08-08T14:44:40.110136Z","RequiredUpToDay":6},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.Day.VillageNominationEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Lucky","Target":"Lord_of_the_Mountain","TotalVotesForPlayer":1,"GameId":"elb-148","TimeStamp":"2025-08-08T14:45:24.1673351Z","RequiredUpToDay":6},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Phases.PlayersVoteReasonGiven, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Lucky","Target":"Lord_of_the_Mountain","Message":"See 14:43","GameId":"elb-148","TimeStamp":"2025-08-08T14:45:35.7076101Z","RequiredUpToDay":6},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Lucky","Message":"(Might change, depends on the discussion that hopefully follows)","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"070d6738-2e54-4717-bdcb-7318776333ed","PlayersIdentity":"Rick","GameId":"elb-148","TimeStamp":"2025-08-08T14:45:49.8349339Z","RequiredUpToDay":6},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"ShaneMcC","Message":"Awww you think I'm good","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"6ee2df16-9e4d-4b60-bc4c-dd388a622c13","PlayersIdentity":"Unity","GameId":"elb-148","TimeStamp":"2025-08-08T14:47:12.4371086Z","RequiredUpToDay":6},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Lucky","Message":"Shut up","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"e9a76d9e-b52c-4dfc-9c90-552aefc49961","PlayersIdentity":"Rick","GameId":"elb-148","TimeStamp":"2025-08-08T14:48:13.893555Z","RequiredUpToDay":6},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Lucky","Message":"😂😘","MentionedIdentities":[],"MentionedPlayers":[],"MessageId":"e3b790e7-c8f3-40cd-9466-b17939cddc91","PlayersIdentity":"Rick","GameId":"elb-148","TimeStamp":"2025-08-08T14:48:19.693259Z","RequiredUpToDay":6},{"__type":"Werewolf.GameEngine.Chatting.VillageMessageEvent, Werewolf.GameEngine","PlayerName":"Lucky","Message":"You cannot be evil.
